    "abstract": "  The status of experimental tests of general relativity and of theoretical frameworks for analyzing them are reviewed and updated. Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP) is well supported by experiments such as the Eotvos experiment, tests of local Lorentz invariance and clock experiments. Ongoing tests of EEP and of the inverse square law are searching for new interactions arising from unification or quantum gravity. Tests of general relativity at the post-Newtonian level have reached high precision, including the light deflection, the Shapiro time delay, the perihelion advance of Mercury, the Nordtvedt effect in lunar motion, and frame-dragging. Gravitational-wave damping has been detected in an amount that agrees with general relativity to better than half a percent using the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar, and a growing family of other binary pulsar systems is yielding new tests, especially of strong-field effects. Current and future tests of relativity will center on strong gravity and gravitational waves. ",

    "abstract": "  We present a family of solutions of Einstein's gravity minimally coupled to a complex, massive scalar field, describing asymptotically flat, spinning black holes with scalar hair and a regular horizon. These hairy black holes (HBHs) are supported by rotation and have no static limit. Besides mass M and angular momentum J, they carry a conserved, continuous Noether charge Q measuring the scalar hair. HBHs branch off from the Kerr metric at the threshold of the superradiant instability and reduce to spinning boson stars in the limit of vanishing horizon area. They overlap with Kerr black holes for a set of (M,J) values. A single Killing vector field preserves the solutions, tangent to the null geodesic generators of the event horizon. HBHs can exhibit sharp physical differences when compared to the Kerr solution, such as J/M^2>1, quadrupole moment larger than J^2/M and larger orbital angular velocity at the innermost stable circular orbit. Families of HBHs connected to the Kerr geometry should exist in scalar (and other) models with more general self interactions. ",

We obtain the metric on the moduli space of the system in the low-velocity limit. We find that: (1) only two-body interactions exist between the extreme black holes in string theory; (2) the mutual interaction between the black holes vanishes if the dilaton can be interpreted as a Kaluza-Klein scalar; and (3) for general dilaton couplings, there exist many-body interactions among the extreme black holes.

    "abstract": "  The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are second generation instruments designed and built for the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA. The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in initial LIGO, Fabry-Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid- and high- frequencies. Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in mid-2015. ",

Geometrically, it describes dynamical foliation of spacelike hypersurfaces coupled to a general background, in which the scalar mode encodes the fluctuation of the hypersurfaces. Within this framework, various models in the literature---including $k$-essence, Horndeski theory, the effective field theory of inflation, ghost condensate as well as the Ho\\v{r}ava gravity---get unified. Our framework generalizes the Horndeski theory in the sense that, it propagates the correct number of degrees of freedom, although the equations of motion are generally higher order. We also identify new operators beyond the Horndeski theory, which yield second order equations of motion for linear perturbations around an a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. ",

    "abstract": "  Certain difficulties of quantum gravity can be avoided if we embed the spacetime $V_4$ into a higher dimensional space $V_N$; then our spacetime is merely a 4-surface in $V_N$.What remains is conceptually not so difficult: just to quantise this 4-surface. Our formal procedure generalises our version of Stueckelberg's proper time method of worldline quantisation. We write the equations of $V_4$ in the covariant canonical form starting from a model Lagrangian which contains the classical Einstein gravity as a particular case. Then we perform quantisation in the Schr\\\"odinger picture by using the concepts of a phase functional and wave functional. As a result we obtain the uncertainty relations which imply that an observer is `aware' either of a particular spacetime surface and has no information about other spacetime surfaces (which represent alternative histories); or conversely, he loses information about a particular $V_4$ whilst he obtains some information about other spacetimes (and histories). Equivalently, one cannot measure to an arbitrary precision both the metric on $V_4$ and matter distribution on various alternative spacetime surfaces. We show how this special case in the `coordinate' representations can be generalised to an arbitrary vector in an abstract Hilbert space. ",

This appears natural in the most general ghost-free, bimetric theory of gravity, where it unlocks an additional symmetry with respect to the exchange of the metrics. This double coupling, however, raises the problem of identifying the observables of the theory. It is shown that if the two metrics couple minimally to matter, then there is no physical metric to which all matter would universally couple, and that moreover such an effective metric generically does not exist even for an individual matter species. By studying point particle dynamics, a resolution is suggested in the context of Finsler geometry. ",

The resulting theory is a novel gravitational modification, since it is different from both f(T) gravity, as well as from the non-minimal curvature-matter-coupled theory. The cosmological application of this new theory proves to be very interesting. In particular, we obtain an effective dark energy sector whose equation-of-state parameter can be quintessence or phantom-like, or exhibit the phantom-divide crossing, while for a large range of the model parameters the Universe results in a de Sitter, dark-energy-dominated, accelerating phase. Additionally, we can obtain early-time inflationary solutions too, and thus provide a unified description of the cosmological history. ",

There exists a single critical point with critical temperature $T_c$ and critical pressure $P_c$. At fixed $T>T_c$ (or at fixed $P>P_c$), there are two zeroth order phase transition points but no first order phase transition points. The systems favors large pressure states at constant $T$, or high temperature states at constant $P$. ",

    "abstract": "  Fundamental fields are a natural outcome in cosmology and particle physics and might therefore serve as a proxy for more complex interactions. The equivalence principle implies that all forms of matter gravitate, and one therefore expects relevant, universal imprints of new physics in strong field gravity, such as that encountered close to black holes. Fundamental fields in the vicinities of supermassive black holes give rise to extremely long-lived, or even unstable, configurations which slowly extract angular momentum from the black hole or simply evolve non-linearly over long timescales, with important implications for particle physics and gravitational-wave physics. Here, we perform a fully non-linear study of scalar-field condensates around rotating black holes. We provide novel ways to specify initial data for the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, with potential applications in a variety of scenarios. Our numerical results confirm the existence of long-lived bar-modes which act as lighthouses for gravitational wave emission: the scalar field condenses outside the black hole geometry and acts as a constant frequency gravitational-wave source for very long timescales. This effect could turn out to be a potential signature of beyond standard model physics and also a promising source of gravitational waves for future gravitational wave detectors. ",

    "abstract": "  Astrophysical charge-free black holes are known to satisfy no-hair relations through which all multipole moments can be specified in terms of just their mass and spin angular momentum. We here investigate the possible existence of no-hair-like relations among multipole moments for neutron stars and quark stars that are independent of their equation of state. We calculate the multipole moments of these stars up to hexadecapole order by constructing uniformly-rotating and unmagnetized stellar solutions to the Einstein equations. For slowly-rotating stars, we construct stellar solutions to quartic order in spin in a slow-rotation expansion, while for rapidly-rotating stars, we solve the Einstein equations numerically with the LORENE and RNS codes. We find that the multipole moments extracted from these numerical solutions are consistent with each other. We confirm that the current-dipole is related to the mass-quadrupole in an approximately equation of state independent fashion, which does not break for rapidly rotating neutron stars or quark stars. We further find that the current-octupole and the mass-hexadecapole moments are related to the mass-quadrupole in an approximately equation of state independent way to $\\sim 10%$, worsening in the hexadecapole case. All of our findings are in good agreement with previous work that considered stellar solutions to leading-order in a weak-field expansion. The quartic in spin, slowly-rotating solutions found here allow us to estimate the systematic errors in the measurement of the neutron star's mass and radius with future X-ray observations, such as NICER and LOFT. We find that the effect of these quartic-in-spin terms on the quadrupole and hexadecapole moments and stellar eccentricity may dominate the error budget for very rapidly-rotating neutron stars. The new universal relations found here should help to reduce such systematic errors. ",

    "abstract": "  Inspired by the teleparallel formulation of General Relativity, whose Lagrangian is the torsion invariant T, we have constructed the teleparallel equivalent of Gauss-Bonnet gravity in arbitrary dimensions. Without imposing the Weitzenbock connection, we have extracted the torsion invariant T_G, equivalent (up to boundary terms) to the Gauss-Bonnet term G. T_G is constructed by the vielbein and the connection, it contains quartic powers of the torsion tensor, it is diffeomorphism and Lorentz invariant, and in four dimensions it reduces to a topological invariant as expected. Imposing the Weitzenbock connection, T_G depends only on the vielbein, and this allows us to consider a novel class of modified gravity theories based on F(T,T_G), which is not spanned by the class of F(T) theories, nor by the F(R,G) class of curvature modified gravity. Finally, varying the action we extract the equations of motion for F(T,T_G) gravity. ",

    "abstract": "  A star that collapses gravitationally can reach a further stage of its life, where quantum-gravitational pressure counteracts weight. The duration of this stage is very short in the star proper time, yielding a bounce, but extremely long seen from the outside, because of the huge gravitational time dilation. Since the onset of quantum-gravitational effects is governed by energy density ---not by size--- the star can be much larger than planckian in this phase. The object emerging at the end of the Hawking evaporation of a black hole can then be larger than planckian by a factor $(m/m_{\\scriptscriptstyle P})^n$, where $m$ is the mass fallen into the hole, $m_{\\scriptscriptstyle P}$ is the Planck mass, and $n$ is positive. We consider arguments for $n=1/3$ and for $n=1$. There is no causality violation or faster-than-light propagation. The existence of these objects alleviates the black-hole information paradox. More interestingly, these objects could have astrophysical and cosmological interest: they produce a detectable signal, of quantum gravitational origin, around the $10^{-14} cm$ wavelength. ",

    "abstract": "  A non-singular bouncing cosmology is generically obtained in loop quantum cosmology due to non-perturbative quantum gravity effects. A similar picture can be achieved in standard general relativity in the presence of a scalar field with a non-standard kinetic term such that at high energy densities the field evolves into a ghost condensate and causes a non-singular bounce. During the bouncing phase, the perturbations can be stabilized by introducing a Horndeski operator. Taking the matter content to be a dust field and an ekpyrotic scalar field, we compare the dynamics in loop quantum cosmology and in a non-singular bouncing effective field model with a non-standard kinetic term at both the background and perturbative levels. We find that these two settings share many important properties, including the result that they both generate scale-invariant scalar perturbations. This shows that some quantum gravity effects of the very early universe may be mimicked by effective field models. ",

    "abstract": "  Gravitational waves from a variety of sources are predicted to superpose to create a stochastic background. This background is expected to contain unique information from throughout the history of the universe that is unavailable through standard electromagnetic observations, making its study of fundamental importance to understanding the evolution of the universe. We carry out a search for the stochastic background with the latest data from LIGO and Virgo. Consistent with predictions from most stochastic gravitational-wave background models, the data display no evidence of a stochastic gravitational-wave signal. Assuming a gravitational-wave spectrum of Omega_GW(f)=Omega_alpha*(f/f_ref)^alpha, we place 95% confidence level upper limits on the energy density of the background in each of four frequency bands spanning 41.5-1726 Hz. In the frequency band of 41.5-169.25 Hz for a spectral index of alpha=0, we constrain the energy density of the stochastic background to be Omega_GW(f)<5.6x10^-6. For the 600-1000 Hz band, Omega_GW(f)<0.14*(f/900 Hz)^3, a factor of 2.5 lower than the best previously reported upper limits. We find Omega_GW(f)<1.8x10^-4 using a spectral index of zero for 170-600 Hz and Omega_GW(f)<1.0*(f/1300 Hz)^3 for 1000-1726 Hz, bands in which no previous direct limits have been placed. The limits in these four bands are the lowest direct measurements to date on the stochastic background. We discuss the implications of these results in light of the recent claim by the BICEP2 experiment of the possible evidence for inflationary gravitational waves. ",

    "abstract": "  Determining the equation of state of matter at nuclear density and hence the structure of neutron stars has been a riddle for decades. We show how the imminent detection of gravitational waves from merging neutron star binaries can be used to solve this riddle. Using a large number of accurate numerical-relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear equations of state, we find that the postmerger emission is characterized by two distinct and robust spectral features. While the high-frequency peak has already been associated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by the merger and depends on the equation of state, a new correlation emerges between the low-frequency peak, related to the merger process, and the total compactness of the stars in the binary. More importantly, such a correlation is essentially universal, thus providing a powerful tool to set tight constraints on the equation of state. If the mass of the binary is known from the inspiral signal, the combined use of the two frequency peaks sets four simultaneous constraints to be satisfied. Ideally, even a single detection would be sufficient to select one equation of state over the others. We test our approach with simulated data and verify it works well for all the equations of state considered. ",

    "abstract": "  The Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational wave (GW) detectors will begin operation in the coming years, with compact binary coalescence events a likely source for the first detections. The gravitational waveforms emitted directly encode information about the sources, including the masses and spins of the compact objects. Recovering the physical parameters of the sources from the GW observations is a key analysis task. This work describes the LALInference software library for Bayesian parameter estimation of compact binary signals, which builds on several previous methods to provide a well-tested toolkit which has already been used for several studies. We show that our implementation is able to correctly recover the parameters of compact binary signals from simulated data from the advanced GW detectors. We demonstrate this with a detailed comparison on three compact binary systems: a binary neutron star, a neutron star black hole binary and a binary black hole, where we show a cross-comparison of results obtained using three independent sampling algorithms. These systems were analysed with non-spinning, aligned spin and generic spin configurations respectively, showing that consistent results can be obtained even with the full 15-dimensional parameter space of the generic spin configurations. We also demonstrate statistically that the Bayesian credible intervals we recover correspond to frequentist confidence intervals under correct prior assumptions by analysing a set of 100 signals drawn from the prior. We discuss the computational cost of these algorithms, and describe the general and problem-specific sampling techniques we have used to improve the efficiency of sampling the compact binary coalescence parameter space.

The equations of motion for this theory are derived using a method which avoids varying the square-root matrix that appears in the matter coupling. We make an ansatz for which the metrics are proportional to each other and find that it can solve the equations provided that one parameter in the action is fixed. In this case, the proportional metrics as well as the effective metric that couples to matter solve Einstein's equations of general relativity including a matter source. Around these backgrounds we derive the quadratic action for perturbations, diagonalized into a massive and a massless spin-2 fluctuation. We find that only the massless spin-2 mode interacts with matter; a result which is independent of the remaining parameters of the theory. ",

    "abstract": "  To understand the effect of third order Lovelock gravity, $P-V$ criticality of topological AdS black holes in Lovelock-Born-Infeld gravity is investigated. The thermodynamics is further explored with some more extensions and details than the former literature. A detailed analysis of the limit case $\\beta\\rightarrow\\infty$ is performed for the seven-dimensional black holes. It is shown that for the spherical topology, $P-V$ criticality exists for both the uncharged and charged cases. Our results demonstrate again that the charge is not the indispensable condition of $P-V$ criticality. It may be attributed to the effect of higher derivative terms of curvature because similar phenomenon was also found for Gauss-Bonnet black holes. For $k=0$, there would be no $P-V$ criticality. Interesting findings occur in the case $k=-1$, in which positive solutions of critical points are found for both the uncharged and charged cases. However, the $P-v$ diagram is quite strange. To check whether these findings are physical, we give the analysis on the non-negative definiteness condition of entropy. It is shown that for any nontrivial value of $\\alpha$, the entropy is always positive for any specific volume $v$. Since no $P-V$ criticality exists for $k=-1$ in Einstein gravity and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we can relate our findings with the peculiar property of third order Lovelock gravity. The entropy in third order Lovelock gravity consists of extra terms which is absent in the Gauss-Bonnet black holes, which makes the critical points satisfy the constraint of non-negative definiteness condition of entropy. We also check the Gibbs free energy graph and the \"swallow tail\" behavior can be observed. Moreover, the effect of nonlinear electrodynamics is also included in our research. ",

    "abstract": "  We construct models of slowly rotating, perfect-fluid neutron stars by extending the classical Hartle-Thorne formalism to generic scalar-tensor theories of gravity. Working at second order in the dimensionless angular momentum, we compute the mass M, radius R, scalar charge q, moment of inertia I and spin-induced quadrupole moment Q, as well as the tidal and rotational Love numbers. Our formalism applies to generic scalar-tensor theories, but we focus in particular on theories that allow for spontaneous scalarization. It was recently discovered that the moment of inertia, quadrupole moment and Love numbers are connected by approximately universal (i.e., equation-of-state independent) \"I-Love-Q\" relations. We find that similar relations hold also for spontaneously scalarized stars. More interestingly, the I-Love-Q relations in scalar-tensor theories coincide with the general relativistic ones within less than a few percent, even for spontaneously scalarized stars with the largest couplings allowed by current binary-pulsar constraints. This implies that astrophysical measurements of these parameters cannot be used to discriminate between general relativity and scalar-tensor theories, even if spontaneous scalarization occurs in nature. Because of the well known equivalence between f(R) theories and scalar-tensor theories, the theoretical framework developed in this paper can be used to construct rotating compact stellar models in f(R) gravity. Our slow-rotation expansion can also be used as a benchmark for numerical calculations of rapidly spinning neutron stars in generic scalar-tensor theories. ",

In the phase space of solutions, the ergo-torus can either appear disconnected from the ergo-sphere or pinch off from it. We provide a heuristic argument, based on a measure of the size of the ergo-region, that superradiant instabilities - which are likely to be present - are weaker for hairy black holes than for Kerr black holes with the same global charges. We observe that Saturn-like, and even more remarkable ergo-surfaces, should also arise for other rotating `hairy' black holes. ",

Expanding the action up to quadratic order in the perturbations and imposing conditions for the elimination of spatial derivatives higher than second order, we obtain the Lagrangian of curvature perturbations and gravitational waves with a single scalar degree of freedom. The resulting second-order Lagrangian is exploited for computing the scalar and tensor power spectra generated during inflation. We also show that the most general scalar-tensor theory with second-order equations of motion-Horndeski theory-belongs to the action of our general EFT framework and that the background equations of motion in Horndeski theory can be conveniently expressed in terms of three EFT parameters. Finally we study the equations of matter density perturbations and the effective gravitational coupling for dark energy models based on Horndeski theory, to confront the models with the observations of large-scale structures and weak lensing.

The purpose of NINJA is to study the ability to detect gravitational waves emitted from merging binary black holes and recover their parameters with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. We report here on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60 complete binary black hole hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. In a \"blind injection challenge\" similar to that conducted in recent LIGO and Virgo science runs, we added 7 hybrid waveforms to two months of data recolored to predictions of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The resulting data was analyzed by gravitational-wave detection algorithms and 6 of the waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a thousand years. Parameter estimation algorithms were run on each of these waveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular momenta and sky position of these waveforms. We also perform a large-scale monte-carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid waveforms with early Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo sensitivity curves. Our results predict that early Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo will have a volume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300Mpc (1Gpc) for $10M_{\\odot}+10M_{\\odot}$ ($50M_{\\odot}+50M_{\\odot}$) binary black hole coalescences. We demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in the waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction in sensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta.

In addition, the on-shell quantum equivalence of $f(R)$ gravity in the Jordan and Einstein frames is explicitly demonstrated. Furthermore, we present applications related to the stability of the de Sitter solutions and the one-loop quantum correction to inflation in quantum-corrected $R^2$ gravity. It is shown that for a certain range of parameters, the spectral index of the curvature perturbations can be consistent with the Planck analysis, but the tensor-to-scalar ratio is smaller than the minimum value within the 1 $\\sigma$ error range of the BICEP2 result.

    "abstract": "  Binary neutron star mergers are studied using nonlinear 3+1 numerical relativity simulations and the analytical effective-one-body (EOB) model. The EOB model predicts quasiuniversal relations between the mass-rescaled gravitational wave frequency and the binding energy at the moment of merger, and certain dimensionless binary tidal coupling constants depending on the stars Love numbers, compactnesses and the binary mass ratio. These relations are quasiuniversal in the sense that, for a given value of the tidal coupling constant, they depend significantly neither on the equation of state nor on the mass ratio, though they do depend on stars spins. The spin dependence is approximately linear for small spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum. The quasiuniversality is a property of the conservative dynamics; nontrivial relations emerge as the binary interaction becomes tidally dominated. This analytical prediction is qualitatively consistent with new, multi-orbit numerical relativity results for the relevant case of equal-mass irrotational binaries. Universal relations are thus expected to characterize neutron star mergers dynamics. In the context of gravitational wave astronomy, these universal relations may be used to constrain the neutron star equation of state using waveforms that model the merger accurately. ",

We also study the effects of waveform modeling bias and individual instances of detector noise on these measurements. We notably find that systematic error between post-Newtonian waveform families can significantly bias the estimation of tidal parameters, thus motivating the continued development of waveform models that are more reliable at high frequencies.

    "abstract": "  We examine reheating in the two-field matter bounce cosmology. In this model, the universe evolves from a matter-dominated phase of contraction to an Ekpyrotic phase of contraction before the nonsingular bounce. The Ekpyrotic phase frees the model from unwanted anisotropies, but leaves the universe cold and empty of particles after the bounce. For this reason, we explore two particle production mechanisms which take place during the course of the cosmological evolution: Parker particle production where the matter field couples only to gravity and particle creation via interactions between the matter field and the bounce field. Although we show that both mechanisms can produce particles in this model, we find that Parker particle production is sufficient to reheat the universe to high temperatures. Thus there is {\\it{a priori}} no need to add an interaction term to the Lagrangian of the model. Still, particle creation via interactions can contribute to the formation of matter and radiation, but only if the coupling between the fields is tuned to be large. ",

This fact implies that there are three degrees of freedom are propagating, of which two correspond to the usual tensor type transverse and traceless gravitons, and one is the scalar type graviton. By restoring the full spacetime diffeomorphism using the St\\\"{u}ckelberg trick, this type of spatially covariant gravity theories corresponds to a large class of single field scalar-tensor theories that possess higher order derivatives in the equations of motion, and thus is beyond the scope of the Horndeski theory.

    "abstract": "  Aiming at a unified phase transition picture of the charged topological black hole in Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity, we investigate this issue not only in canonical ensemble with the fixed charge case but also in grand-canonical ensemble with the fixed potential case. We firstly perform the standard analysis of the specific heat, the free energy and the Gibbs potential, and then study its geometrothermodynamics. It is shown that the local phase transition points not only witness the divergence of the specific heat, but also witness the minimum temperature and the maximum free energy or Gibbs potential. They also witness the divergence of the corresponding thermodynamic scalar curvature. No matter which ensemble is chosen, the metric constructed can successfully produce the behavior of the thermodynamic interaction and phase transition structure while other metrics failed to predict the phase transition point of the charged topological black hole in former literature. In grand-canonical ensemble, we have discovered the phase transition which has not been reported before. It is similar to the canonical ensemble in which the phase transition only takes place when $k=-1$. But it also has its unique characteristics that the location of the phase transition point depends on the value of potential, which is different from the canonical ensemble where the phase transition point is independent of the parameters. After an analytical check of Ehrenfest scheme, we find that the new phase transition is a second order one. It is also found that the thermodynamics of the black hole in Horava-Lifshitz gravity is quite different from that in Einstein gravity. ",

To this end, we review a powerful and elegant resummation method, which is mathematically identical to the standard renormalization group treatment of ultraviolet divergences in perturbative quantum field theory. We apply this method to non-linear gravitational perturbation theory in the AdS background at first non-trivial order and display the detailed structure of the emerging renormalization flow equations. We prove, in particular, that a majority of secular terms (and the corresponding terms in the renormalization flow equations) that could be present on general grounds given the spectrum of frequencies of linear AdS perturbations, do not in fact arise.

    "abstract": "  [abridged abstract] No, within a broad class of scenarios. With the advent of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy, environmental effects on the GW signal will eventually have to be quantified. Here we present a wide survey of the corrections due to these effects in two situations of great interest for GW astronomy: the black hole (BH) ringdown emission and the inspiral of two compact objects. We take into account various effects such as: electric charges, magnetic fields, cosmological evolution, possible deviations from General Relativity, firewalls, and various forms of matter such as accretion disks and dark matter halos. Our analysis predicts the existence of resonances dictated by the external mass distribution, which dominate the very late-time behavior of merger/ringdown waveforms. The mode structure can drastically differ from the vacuum case, yet the BH response to external perturbations is unchanged at the time scales relevant for detectors. This is because although the vacuum Schwarzschild resonances are no longer quasinormal modes of the system, they still dominate the response at intermediate times. Our results strongly suggest that both parametrized and ringdown searches should use at least two-mode templates. Our analysis of compact binaries shows that environmental effects are typically negligible for most eLISA sources, with the exception of very few special extreme mass ratio inspirals. We show in particular that accretion and hydrodynamic drag generically dominate over self-force effects for geometrically thin disks, whereas they can be safely neglected for geometrically thick disk environments, which are the most relevant for eLISA. Finally, we discuss how our ignorance of the matter surrounding compact objects implies intrinsic limits on the ability to constrain strong-field deviations from General Relativity. ",

However, recent data from BICEP2 is in strong tension with this constrain, as it finds a value $r=0.20^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$ with $r=0$ disfavored at $7.0 \\sigma$, which allows these simplest inflationary models to survive. The remarkable fact is that, even though the BICEP2 experiment was conceived to search for evidence of inflation, its experimental data matches correctly theoretical results coming from the matter bounce scenario (the alternative model to the inflationary paradigm). More precisely, most bouncing cosmologies do not pass Planck's constrains due to the smallness of the value of the tensor/scalar ratio $r\\leq 0.11$, but with new BICEP2 data some of them fit well with experimental data. This is the case with the matter bounce scenario in the teleparallel version of Loop Quantum Cosmology. ",

We review how nonlinear observables of a free field, such as the stress-energy tensor, are defined, as well as time-ordered-products. The \"renormalization ambiguities\" involved in the definition of time-ordered products are fully characterized. Interacting fields are then perturbatively constructed.

This approach yields four gauge-invariant functions, from which one may construct other tidal quantities such as the curvature scalars and the speciality index. First, we analyze the general case of a geodesic in a regular perturbed vacuum spacetime admitting a helical Killing vector and a reflection symmetry. Next, we specialize to focus on circular orbits in the equatorial plane of Kerr spacetime at $O(\\mu)$. We present accurate numerical results for the Schwarzschild case for orbital radii up to the light-ring, calculated via independent implementations in Lorenz and Regge-Wheeler gauges.

The so-called cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ should be an approximation, certainly a good one for a fraction of a Hubble time, but it is most likely a temporary description of a true dynamical vacuum energy variable that is evolving from the inflationary epoch to the present day. We can compare the evolving vacuum energy with a Casimir device where the parallel plates slowly move apart (\"expand\"). The total vacuum energy density cannot be measured, only the effect associated to the presence of the plates, and then also their increasing separation with time. In the universe there is a nonvanishing spacetime curvature $R$ as compared to Minkowskian spacetime that is changing with the expansion. The vacuum energy density must change accordingly, and we naturally expect $\\delta\\Lambda\\sim R\\sim H^2$. A class of dynamical vacuum models that trace such rate of change can be constructed. They are compatible with the current cosmological data, and conveniently extended can account for the complete cosmic evolution from the inflationary epoch till the present days.

    "abstract": "  The BICEP2 collaboration has recently released data showing that the scalar-to-tensor ratio $r$ is much larger than expected. The immediate consequence, in the context of $f(R)$ gravity, is that the Starobinsky model of inflation is ruled out since it predicts a value of $r$ much smaller than what is observed. Of course, the BICEP2 data need verification, especially from Planck with which there is some tension, therefore any conclusion seems premature. However, it is interesting to ask what would be the functional form of $f(R)$ in the case when the value of $r$ is different from the one predicted by the Starobinsky model. In this paper, we show how to determine the form of $f(R)$, once the slow-roll parameters are known with some accuracy. The striking result is that, for given values of the scalar spectral index $n_{S}$ and $r$, the effective Lagrangian has the form $f(R)=R^{\\zeta}$, where $\\zeta=2-\\varepsilon$ and $|\\varepsilon|\\ll 1$. Therefore, it appears that the inflationary phase of the Universe is best described by a $R^{2}$ theory, with a small deviation that, as we show, can be obtained by quantum corrections. ",

    "abstract": "  It is commonly accepted that general relativity is the only solution to the consistency problem that appears when trying to build a theory of interacting gravitons (massless spin-2 particles). Padmanabhan's 2008 thought-provoking analysis raised some concerns that are having resonance in the community. In this work we present the self-coupling problem in detail and explicitly solve the infinite-iterations scheme associated with it for the simplest theory of a graviton field, which corresponds to an irreducible spin-2 representation of the Poincar\\'e group. We make explicit the non-uniqueness problem by finding an entire family of solutions to the self-coupling problem. Then we show that the only resulting theory which implements a deformation of the original gauge symmetry happens to have essentially the structure of unimodular gravity. This makes plausible the possibility of a natural solution to the first cosmological constant problem in theories of emergent gravity. Later on we change for the sake of completeness the starting free-field theory to Fierz-Pauli theory, an equivalent theory but with a larger gauge symmetry. We indicate how to carry out the infinite summation procedure in a similar way. Overall, we conclude that as long as one requires the (deformed) preservation of internal gauge invariance, one naturally recovers the structure of unimodular gravity or general relativity but in a version that explicitly shows the underlying Minkowski spacetime, in the spirit of Rosen's flat-background bimetric theory.

    "abstract": "  To provide an analytic verification of the nature of phase transition at the critical point of $P-V$ criticality, the original expressions of Ehrenfest equations have been introduced directly. By treating the cosmological constant and its conjugate quantity as thermodynamic pressure and volume respectively, we carry out analytical check of classical Ehrenfest equations. To show that our approach is universal, we investigate not only higher-dimensional charged AdS black holes, but also rotating AdS black holes. Not only are the examples of Einstein gravity shown, but also the example of modified gravity is presented for Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes. The specific heat at constant pressure $C_P$, the volume expansion coefficient $\\alpha$ and the isothermal compressibility coefficient $\\kappa_T$ are found to diverge exactly at the critical point. It has been verified that both Ehrenfest equations hold at the critical point of $P-V$ criticality in the extended phase spaces of AdS black holes. So the nature of the critical point of $P-V$ criticality of AdS black holes has been demonstrated analytically to be a second-order phase transition. These results are consistent with the nature of liquid-gas phase transition at the critical point. In this sense, our research would deepen the understanding of the relations of AdS black holes and liquid-gas systems. Moreover, our successful approaches to introduce the original expressions of Erhenfest equations directly into black hole phase transition research demonstrate again that black hole thermodynamics is closely related to classical thermodynamics, which allows us to borrow techniques from classical thermodynamics to investigate the thermodynamics of black holes.

We focus our study in two limits of the cosmic time, the large cosmic time limit and the small cosmic time limit. For the former, we found that, in the presence of non-interacting and non-relativistic matter, the $F(R)$ gravity that reproduces the late time limit of the matter bounce solution is actually the Einstein-Hilbert gravity plus a power law term. In the early time limit, since it corresponds to large spacetime curvatures, assuming that the Jordan frame is described by a general metric that when it is conformally transformed to the Einstein frame, produces an accelerating Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, we found explicitly the scalar field dependence on time. After demonstrating that the solution in the Einstein frame is indeed accelerating, we calculate the spectral index derived from the Einstein frame scalar-tensor counterpart theory of the $F(R)$ theory and compare it with the Planck experiment data. In order to implement the resulting picture, we embed the $F(R)$ gravity explicitly in a Loop Quantum Cosmology framework by introducing holonomy corrections to the $F(R)$ gravity. In this way, the resulting inflation picture corresponding to the $F(R)$ gravity can be corrected in order it coincides to some extent with the current experimental data. ",

    "abstract": "  The data analysis of the gravitational wave signals emitted by coalescing neutron star binaries requires the availability of an accurate analytical representation of the dynamics and waveforms of these systems. We propose an effective-one-body (EOB) model that describes the general relativistic dynamics of neutron star binaries from the early inspiral up to merger. Our EOB model incorporates an enhanced attractive tidal potential motivated by recent analytical advances in the post-Newtonian and gravitational self-force description of relativistic tidal interactions. No fitting parameters are introduced for the description of tidal interaction in the late, strong-field dynamics. We compare the model energetics and the gravitational wave phasing with new high-resolution multi-orbit numerical relativity simulations of equal-mass configurations with different equations of state. We find agreement within the uncertainty of the numerical data for all configurations. Our model is the first semi-analytical model which captures the tidal amplification effects close to merger. It thereby provides the most accurate analytical representation of binary neutron star dynamics and waveforms currently available. ",

The scenario preserves unitarity without any need for a \"firewall\" in the vicinity of the outer apparent horizon. Qbits in the Hawking radiation are never mutually entangled, and their number never exceeds the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole. The quantum back-reaction, while it must be very large in the deep interior of the black hole, can be described semi-classically in the vicinity of the outer apparent horizon up until close to the Page time. An explicit toy model for the metric in the interior of the black hole, and how its associated energy-momentum tensor can be continued to the exterior in a semi-classical approximation, is discussed.

The former scalar is a Galileon with shift symmetry whereas the latter scalar is adjusted to have a higher order conformal coupling. Employing technics from local Weyl geometry certain Galileon higher order terms are thus constructed to be conformally invariant. The combined shift and partial conformal symmetry of the action, allow us to construct exact black hole solutions. The black holes initially found are of planar horizon geometry embedded in anti de Sitter space and can accommodate electric charge. The conformally coupled scalar comes with an additional independent charge and it is well-defined on the horizon whereas additional regularity of the Galileon field is achieved allowing for time dependence. Guided by our results in adS space-time we then consider a higher order version of the BBMB action and construct asymptotically flat, regular, hairy black holes. The addition of the Galileon field is seen to cure the BBMB scalar horizon singularity while allowing for the presence of primary scalar hair seen as an independent integration constant along-side the mass of the black hole.

We refine the theoretical description of tidal interactions (hitherto known only to the second post-Newtonian level) by extending our recently developed analytic self-force formalism, for extreme mass-ratio binary systems, to the computation of several tidal invariants. Specifically, we compute, to linear order in the mass ratio and to the 7.5$^{\\rm th}$ post-Newtonian order, the following tidal invariants: the square and the cube of the gravitoelectric quadrupolar tidal tensor, the square of the gravitomagnetic quadrupolar tidal tensor, and the square of the gravitoelectric octupolar tidal tensor. Our high-accuracy analytic results are compared to recent numerical self-force tidal data by Dolan et al. \\cite{Dolan:2014pja}, and, notably, provide an analytic understanding of the light ring asymptotic behavior found by them. We transcribe our kinematical tidal-invariant results in the more dynamically significant effective one-body description of the tidal interaction energy. By combining, in a synergetic manner, analytical and numerical results, we provide simple, accurate analytic representations of the global, strong-field behavior of the gravitoelectric quadrupolar tidal factor. A striking finding is that the linear-in-mass-ratio piece in the latter tidal factor changes sign in the strong-field domain, to become negative (while its previously known second post-Newtonian approximant was always positive). We, however, argue that this will be more than compensated by a probable fast growth, in the strong-field domain, of the nonlinear-in-mass-ratio contributions in the tidal factor. ",

    "abstract": "  Before the 1970s, precision tests for gravity theories were constrained to the weak gravitational fields of the Solar system. Hence, only the weak-field slow-motion aspects of relativistic celestial mechanics could be investigated. Testing gravity beyond the first post-Newtonian contributions was for a long time out of reach.   The discovery of the first binary pulsar by Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor in the summer of 1974 initiated a completely new field for testing the relativistic dynamics of gravitationally interacting bodies. For the first time the back reaction of gravitational wave emission on the binary motion could be studied. Furthermore, the Hulse-Taylor pulsar provided the first test bed for the orbital dynamics of strongly self-gravitating bodies.   To date there are a number of pulsars known, which can be utilized for precision test of gravity. Depending on their orbital properties and their companion, these pulsars provide tests for various different aspects of relativistic dynamics. Besides tests of specific gravity theories, like general relativity or scalar-tensor gravity, there are pulsars that allow for generic constraints on potential deviations of gravity from general relativity in the quasi-stationary strong-field and the radiative regime.   This article presents a brief overview of this modern field of relativistic celestial mechanics, reviews some of the highlights of gravity tests with radio pulsars, and discusses their implications for gravitational physics and astronomy, including the upcoming gravitational wave astronomy.

We discuss the consequences of the resulting scale invariant theory of gravity and particles for high-energy physics and cosmology. We found that nothing besides scale invariance and cosmological inflation is required to explain the large hierarchy between the Higgs and the Planck masses. In the present setup the late-time speedup of the cosmic expansion can be explained without the need for the dark energy. Moreover, the observational evidence on accelerated expansion can be explained even if the Universe is not expanding at all.

    "abstract": "  A temporally varying discretization often features in discrete gravitational systems and appears in lattice field theory models subject to a coarse graining or refining dynamics. To better understand such discretization changing dynamics in the quantum theory, an according formalism for constrained variational discrete systems is constructed. While the present manuscript focuses on global evolution moves and, for simplicity, restricts to Euclidean configuration spaces, a companion article discusses local evolution moves. In order to link the covariant and canonical picture, the dynamics of the quantum states is generated by propagators which satisfy the canonical constraints and are constructed using the action and group averaging projectors. This projector formalism offers a systematic method for tracing and regularizing divergences in the resulting state sums. Non-trivial coarse graining evolution moves lead to non-unitary, and thus irreversible, projections of physical Hilbert spaces and Dirac observables such that these concepts become evolution move dependent on temporally varying discretizations. The formalism is illustrated in a toy model mimicking a `creation from nothing'. Subtleties arising when applying such a formalism to quantum gravity models are discussed. ",

For coalescing compact-binary sources this requires accurate model templates for the inspiral and, potentially, the subsequent merger and ringdown. Models with frequency-domain waveforms that terminate abruptly in the sensitive band of the detector are often used for parameter-estimation studies. We show that the abrupt waveform termination contains significant information that affects parameter-estimation accuracy. If the sharp cutoff is not physically motivated, this extra information can lead to misleadingly good accuracy claims. We also show that using waveforms with a cutoff as templates to recover complete signals can lead to biases in parameter estimates. We evaluate when the information content in the cutoff is likely to be important in both cases. We also point out that the standard Fisher matrix formalism, frequently employed for approximately predicting parameter-estimation accuracy, cannot properly incorporate an abrupt cutoff that is present in both signals and templates; this observation explains some previously unexpected results found in the literature. These effects emphasize the importance of using complete waveforms with accurate merger and ringdown phases for parameter estimation. ",

Their treatment is easiest in the second-quantised group field theory formalism which allows the adaptation of techniques from the description of Bose-Einstein condensates in condensed matter physics. Dynamical equations for the states can be derived directly from the underlying quantum gravity dynamics. The analogue of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation defines an anisotropic quantum cosmology model, in which the condensate wavefunction becomes a quantum cosmology wavefunction on minisuperspace. To illustrate this general formalism, we give a mapping of the gauge-invariant geometric data for a tetrahedron to a minisuperspace of homogeneous anisotropic 3-metrics. We then study an example for which we give the resulting quantum cosmology model in the general anisotropic case and derive the general analytical solution for isotropic universes. We discuss the interpretation of these solutions. We suggest that the WKB approximation used in previous studies, corresponding to semiclassical fundamental degrees of freedom of quantum geometry, should be replaced by a notion of semiclassicality that refers to large-scale observables instead.

    "abstract": "  A co-rotating bosonic field interacting with a spinning Kerr black hole can extract rotational energy and angular momentum from the hole. This intriguing phenomenon is known as superradiant scattering. As pointed out by Press and Teukolsky, the black-hole-field system can be made unstable (explosive) by placing a reflecting mirror around the black hole which prevents the extracted energy from escaping to infinity. This composed black-hole-mirror-field bomb has been studied extensively by many researchers. It is worth noting, however, that most former studies of the black-hole bomb phenomenon have focused on the specific case of confined scalar (spin-$0$) fields. In the present study we explore the physical properties of the higher-spin (electromagnetic and gravitational) black-hole bombs. It is shown that this composed system is amenable to an analytic treatment in the physically interesting regime of rapidly-rotating black holes. In particular, we prove that the composed black-hole-mirror-field bomb is characterized by the unstable resonance frequency $\\omega=m\\Omega_{\\text{H}}+is\\cdot 2\\pi T_{\\text{BH}}$ (here $s$ and $m$ are respectively the spin-parameter and the azimuthal harmonic index of the field, and $\\Omega_{\\text{H}}$ and $T_{\\text{BH}}$ are respectively the angular-velocity and the temperature of the rapidly-spinning black hole). Our results provide evidence that the higher-spin (electromagnetic and gravitational) black-hole-mirror bombs are much more explosive than the extensively studied scalar black-hole-mirror bomb. In particular, it is shown here that the instability growth rates which characterize the higher-spin black-hole bombs are two orders of magnitudes larger than the instability growth rate of the scalar black-hole bomb.

Its resolution is more than of academic interest, as it allows to parametrize and quantify possible deviations from the no-hair theorem. Various approaches to the problem have been proposed, all with their own (severe) limitations. Here we discuss the metric recently proposed by Johannsen and Psaltis, showing that (i) the original metric describes only corrections that preserve the horizon area-mass relation of nonspinning geometries; (ii) this unnecessary restriction can be relaxed by introducing a new parameter that in fact dominates in both the post-Newtonian and strong-field regimes; (iii) within this framework, we construct the most generic spinning black-hole geometry which contains twice as many the (infinite) parameters of the original metric; (iv) in the strong-field regime, all parameters are roughly equally important. This fact introduces a severe degeneracy problem in the case of highly-spinning black holes.

    "abstract": "  Black-hole binary coalescences are one of the most promising sources for the first detection of gravitational waves. Fast and accurate theoretical models of the gravitational radiation emitted from these coalescences are highly important for the detection and extraction of physical parameters. Spinning effective-one-body (EOB) models for binaries with aligned spins have been shown to be highly faithful, but are slow to generate and thus have not yet been used for parameter estimation studies. I provide a frequency-domain singular value decomposition (SVD)-based surrogate reduced order model that is thousands of times faster for typical system masses and has a faithfulness mismatch of better than $\\sim 0.1\\%$ with the original SEOBNRv1 model for advanced LIGO detectors. This model enables parameter estimation studies up to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 20 and even up to SNR 50 for total masses below $50 M_\\odot$. This article discusses various choices for approximations and interpolation over the parameter space that can be made for reduced order models of spinning compact binaries, provides a detailed discussion of errors arising in the construction and assesses the fidelity of such models.

In the present paper, by using the formalism of open thermodynamic systems, we interpret the generalized conservation equations in these gravitational theories from a thermodynamic point of view as describing irreversible matter creation processes, which could be validated by fundamental particle physics. Thus particle creation corresponds to an irreversible energy flow from the gravitational field to the created matter constituents, with the second law of thermodynamics requiring that space-time transforms into matter. The equivalent particle number creation rates, the creation pressure and the entropy production rates are obtained for both $f\\left(R,L_m\\right)$ and $f(R,T)$ gravity theories. The temperature evolution laws of the newly created particles are also obtained. In the case of the $f(R,T)$ gravity theory the open irreversible thermodynamic interpretation of a simple cosmological model is presented in detail.

However, very little is known about the development of the instability and whether its nonlinear time evolution accords to the linear intuition. For the first time, we attack this problem by studying the impact of gravitational-wave emission and gas accretion on the evolution of the instability. Our quasi-adiabatic, fully-relativistic analysis shows that: (i) gravitational-wave emission does not have a significant effect on the evolution of the black hole, (ii) accretion plays an important role and (iii) although the mass of the scalar cloud developed through superradiance can be a sizeable fraction of the black-hole mass, its energy-density is very low and backreaction is negligible. Thus, massive black holes are well described by the Kerr geometry even if they develop bosonic clouds through superradiance. Using Monte Carlo methods and very conservative assumptions, we provide strong support to the validity of the linearized analysis and to the bounds of previous studies. ",

    "abstract": "  Black holes are said to have no hair because all of their multipole moments can be expressed in terms of just their mass, charge and spin angular momentum. The recent discovery of approximately equation-of-state-independent relations among certain multipole moments in neutron stars suggests that they are also approximately bald. We here explore the yet unknown origin for this universality. First, we investigate which region of the neutron star's interior and of the equation of state is most responsible for the universality. We find that the universal relation between the moment of inertia and the quadrupole moment is dominated by the star's outer-core, a shell of width (50-95)% of the total radius, which corresponds to the density range $(10^{14}$-$10^{15})$g/cm$^3$. Second, we study the impact on the universality of approximating stellar isodensity contours as self-similar ellipsoids. An analytical calculation in the Newtonian limit reveals that the shape of the ellipsoids does not affect the universal relations, but relaxing the self-similarity assumption can completely destroy it. Third, we investigate the eccentricity profiles of rotating relativistic stars and find that the ellipticity is roughly constant, with variations of roughly (20-30)% in the region that matters to the universal relations. Fourth, we repeat the above analysis for non-compact, regular stars and find that the ellipticity is not constant, with variations that easily exceed 100% and universality is lost. These findings suggest that universality arises as an emergent approximate symmetry: as one flows in the stellar-structure phase space from non-compact star region to the relativistic star region, the eccentricity variation inside stars decreases, leading to approximate self-similarity in their isodensity contours, which then leads to the universal behavior observed in their exterior multipole moments.

By computing the quasi-bound state frequencies, we establish that no such states exist in the superradiant regime for the Proca field -- a similar behavior to that known for scalar fields. But decaying quasi-bound states with an arbitrarily small imaginary part of the frequency exist and thus which are arbitrarily long lived. In the limit of vanishing imaginary part of the frequency, the field does not trivialize and we dub the corresponding configurations as marginal (charged) scalar or Proca clouds, since they are only marginally bound.

However, the \\emph{puncture}, a local representation of the small object's self-field, in each of these schemes has been presented only in a local coordinate system centered on the small object, while a numerical implementation will require the puncture in coordinates covering the entire numerical domain. In this paper we provide an explicit covariant self-field as a local expansion in terms of Synge's world function. The self-field is written in the Lorenz gauge, in an arbitrary vacuum background, and in forms suitable for both self-consistent and Gralla-Wald-type representations of the object's trajectory. We illustrate the local expansion's utility by sketching the procedure of constructing from it a numerically practical puncture in any chosen coordinate system. ",

    "abstract": "  General relativity makes clear predictions about the spacetime geometry around black holes. In the near future, new facilities will have the capability to explore the metric around SgrA$^*$, the supermassive black hole candidate at the Center of our Galaxy, and open a new window to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. In this paper, we compute light curves and images associated with compact emission regions (hot spots) orbiting around Kerr and non-Kerr black holes. We study how the analysis of the properties of the radiation emitted by a hot spot can be used to test the Kerr nature of SgrA$^*$. We find that the sole observation of the hot spot light curve can at most constrain a combination of the black hole spin and of possible deviations from the Kerr solution. This happens because the same orbital frequency around a Kerr black hole can be found for a non-Kerr object with a different spin parameter. Second order corrections in the light curve due to the background geometry are typically too small to be identified. While the observation of the hot spot centroid track can potentially bound possible deviations from the Kerr solution, that is out of reach for the near future VLTI instrument GRAVITY. The Kerr black hole hypothesis could really be tested in the case of the discovery of a radio pulsar in a compact orbit around SgrA$^*$. Radio observations of such a pulsar would provide precise estimates of the mass and the spin of SgrA$^*$, and the combination of these measurements (probing the weak field) with the hot spot light curve information (probing the strong field) may constrain/find possible deviations from the Kerr solution with quite good precision.

That completion proceeds in an order dictated by the additional layers of mathematical structure required to support each. Moreover, the `nonlinear nature' of the interactions between the Problem of Time facets renders a joint study of them mandatory.

The orbital motion and gravitational-wave emission of such system can be modelled using a variety of approximation schemes and numerical methods in general relativity: the post-Newtonian formalism, black hole perturbation theory, numerical relativity simulations, and the effective one-body model. We review recent work at the multiple interfaces of these analytical and numerical techniques, emphasizing the use of coordinate-invariant relationships to perform meaningful comparisons. Such comparisons provide independent checks of the validity of the various calculations, they inform the development of a universal, semi-analytical model of the binary dynamics and gravitational-wave emission, and they help to delineate the respective domains of validity of each approximation method. For instance, several recent comparisons suggest that perturbation theory may find applications in a broader range of physical problems than previously thought, including the radiative inspiral of intermediate mass-ratio and comparable-mass black hole binaries.

Binary systems containing one or two spinning black holes are particularly interesting due to spin-orbit (and eventual spin-spin) interactions, and the opportunity of measuring spins directly through GW observations. In this letter we analyze simulated signals emitted by spinning binaries with several values of masses, spins, orientation, and signal-to-noise ratio. We find that spin magnitudes and tilt angles can be estimated to accuracy of a few percent for neutron star--black hole systems and $\\sim$ 5-30% for black hole binaries. In contrast, the difference in the azimuth angles of the spins, which may be used to check if spins are locked into resonant configurations, cannot be constrained. We observe that the best performances are obtained when the line of sight is perpendicular to the system's total angular momentum, and that a sudden change of behavior occurs when a system is observed from angles such that the plane of the orbit can be seen both from above and below during the time the signal is in band. This study suggests that the measurement of black hole spin by means of GWs can be as precise as what can be obtained from X-ray binaries. ",

    "abstract": "  Several quantum gravity approaches and field theory on an evolving lattice involve a discretization changing dynamics generated by evolution moves. Local evolution moves in variational discrete systems (1) are a generalization of the Pachner evolution moves of simplicial gravity models, (2) update only a small subset of the dynamical data, (3) change the number of kinematical and physical degrees of freedom, and (4) generate a dynamical coarse graining or refining of the underlying discretization. To systematically explore such local moves and their implications in the quantum theory, this article suitably expands the quantum formalism for global evolution moves, constructed in a companion paper, by employing that global moves can be decomposed into sequences of local moves. This formalism is spelled out for systems with Euclidean configuration spaces. Various types of local moves, the different kinds of constraints generated by them, the constraint preservation and possible divergences in resulting state sums are discussed. It is shown that non-trivial local coarse graining moves entail a non-unitary projection of (physical) Hilbert spaces and `fine grained' Dirac observables defined on them. Identities for undoing a local evolution move with its (time reversed) inverse are derived. Finally, the implications of these results for a Pachner move generated dynamics in simplicial quantum gravity models are commented on. ",

For the effects discussed here, loops cause the evolution of a(t) to depend on the memory of the curvature in the past with a weight that scales initially as 1/(t-t'). As one of our primary examples we discuss the situation with a large number of light particles, such that these effects occur in a region where gravity may still be treated classically. However, we also describe the effect of quantum graviton loops and the full set of Standard Model particles. We show that these effects decrease with time in an expanding phase, leading to classical behavior at late time. In a contracting phase, within our approximations the quantum results can lead to a bounce-like behavior at scales below the Planck mass, avoiding the singularities required classically by the Hawking-Penrose theorems. For conformally invariant fields, such as the Standard Model with a conformally coupled Higgs, this result is purely non-local and parameter independent. ",

We present a brief but concise description of the concepts needed to join the two ends, which include discussion on scalar field dynamic, conformal coupling, instant preheating and relic gravitational waves. Models of quintessential inflation broadly fall into two classes, depending upon the early and late time behavior of the field potential. In the first type we include models in which the field potential is steep for most of the history of the Universe but turn shallow at late times, whereas in the second type the potential is shallow at early times followed by a steep behavior thereafter. In models of the first category inflation can be realized by invoking high-energy brane-induced damping, which is needed to facilitate slow roll along a steep potential. In models of second type one may invoke a non-minimal coupling of the scalar field with massive neutrino matter, which might induce a minimum in the potential at late times as neutrinos turn non-relativistic. In this category we review a class of models with non-canonical kinetic term in the Lagrangian, which can comply with recent B mode polarization measurements. The scenario under consideration is distinguished by the presence of a kinetic phase, which precedes the radiative regime, giving rise to blue spectrum of gravity waves generated during inflation. We highlight the generic features of quintessential inflation and also discuss on issues related to Lyth bound. ",

    "abstract": "  A distance can be measured by monitoring how much a wheel has rotated when rolled without slipping. This simple idea underlies the mathematics of Cartan geometry. The Cartan-geometric description of gravity consists of a SO(1,4) gauge connection $A^{AB}(x)$ and a symmetry-breaking field $V^A(x)$. The clear similarity with symmetry-broken Yang-Mills theory suggests strongly the existence of a new field in nature: the gravitational Higgs field $V^A$. By treating $V^A$ as a genuine dynamical field we arrive at a natural generalization of General Relativity with a wealth of new phenomenology and with General Relativity reproduced exactly in the limit where $V^2$ tends to a positive constant. We show that in regions wherein $V^2(x)$ varies, but has a definite sign, the Cartan-geometric formulation is a form of a scalar-tensor theory. A specific choice of action yields the Peebles-Ratra quintessence model whilst more general actions are shown to exhibit propagation of torsion. Regions where the sign of $V^2$ changes correspond to a change in signature of the geometry; a simple choice of action with FRW symmetry yields, without any additional ad hoc assumptions, a classical analogue of the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal. Solutions from more general actions are discussed. A gauge prescription for coupling matter to gravity is described and matter actions are presented which reduce to standard ones in the limit $V^2\\rightarrow const$. It becomes clear that Cartan geometry may function as a novel platform for inspiring and exploring modified theories of gravity with applications to dark energy, black holes, and early-universe cosmology. We end by listing a set of open problems. ",

The models which are designed to implement the minimal length scale and/or the maximum momentum in different physical systems are analysed entered the literature as the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We compare between them. The existence of a minimal length and a maximum momentum accuracy is preferred by various physical observations. Furthermore, assuming modified dispersion relation allows for a wide range of applications in estimating, for example, the inflationary parameters, Lorentz invariance violation, black hole thermodynamics, Saleker-Wigner inequalities, entropic nature of the gravitational laws, Friedmann equations, minimal time measurement and thermodynamics of the high-energy collisions. One of the higher-order GUP approaches gives predictions for the minimal length uncertainty. Another one predicts a maximum momentum and a minimal length uncertainty, simultaneously. An extensive comparison between the different GUP approaches is summarized. We also discuss the GUP impacts on the equivalence principles including the universality of the gravitational redshift and the free fall and law of reciprocal action and on the kinetic energy of composite system. The concern about the compatibility with the equivalence principles, the universality of gravitational redshift and the free fall and law of reciprocal action should be addressed. We conclude that the value of the GUP parameters remain a puzzle to be verified. ",

As the structure of the accretion disk and the propagation of electromagnetic radiation from the disk to the distant observer depend on the background metric, the analysis of the thermal spectrum of thin disks can be used to test the actual nature of black hole candidates. In this paper, we consider the 10 stellar-mass black hole candidates for which the spin parameter has been already estimated from the analysis of the disk's thermal spectrum and under the assumption of the Kerr background, and we translate the measurements reported in the literature into constraints on the spin parameter--deformation parameter plane. The analysis of the disk's thermal spectrum can be used to estimate only one parameter of the geometry close to the compact object, and therefore it is not possible to get independent measurements of both the spin and the deformation parameters. The constraints obtained here will be used in combination with other measurements in future work, with the final goal to break the degeneracy between the spin and possible deviations from the Kerr solution and thus test the Kerr black hole hypothesis.

Using the lalinference\\_mcmc Markov-chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation code, we use two fiducial examples to illustrate how the geometry and kinematics are encoded into the modulated gravitational wave signal, using coordinates well-adapted to precession. Even for precessing binaries, we show the performance of detailed parameter estimation can be estimated by \"effective\" estimates: comparisons of a prototype signal with its nearest neighbors, adopting a fixed sky location and idealized two-detector network. We use detailed and effective approaches to show higher harmonics provide nonzero but small local improvement when estimating the parameters of precessing BH-NS binaries. That said, we show higher harmonics can improve parameter estimation accuracy for precessing binaries ruling out approximately-degenerate source orientations.   Our work illustrates quantities gravitational wave measurements can provide, such as reliable component masses and the precise orientation of a precessing short gamma ray burst progenitor relative to the line of sight. \"Effective\" estimates may provide a simple way to estimate trends in the performance of parameter estimation for generic precessing BH-NS binaries in next-generation detectors. For example, our results suggest that the orbital chirp rate, precession rate, and precession geometry are roughly-independent observables, defining natural variables to organize correlations in the high-dimensional BH-NS binary parameter space.

In 4-dimensional general relativity, the no-hair theorem asserts that uncharged black holes are described by the Kerr solution and are completely specified by their mass $M$ and by their spin parameter $a$. In this paper, we explore the possibility of distinguishing Kerr and Bardeen black holes from their shadow. In Hioki & Maeda (2009), under the assumption that the background geometry is described by the Kerr solution, the authors proposed an algorithm to estimate the value of $a/M$ by measuring the distortion parameter $\\delta$, an observable quantity that characterizes the shape of the shadow. Here, we try to extend their approach. Since the Hioki-Maeda distortion parameter is degenerate with respect to the spin and possible deviations from the Kerr solution, one has to measure another quantity to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. We study a few possibilities. We find that it is extremely difficult to distinguish Kerr and Bardeen black holes from the sole observation of the shadow, and out of reach for the near future. The combination of the measurement of the shadow with possible accurate radio observations of a pulsar in a compact orbit around SgrA$^*$ could be a more promising strategy to verify the Kerr black hole paradigm.

    "abstract": "  In this paper we consider an extended Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory in arbitrary dimensions and in a space provided with a Weyl connection, which is torsionless but not metric-compatible, the non-metricity tensor being determined by a vector field. The considered action consists of the usual Einstein-Hilbert action plus all the terms quadratic in the curvature that reduce to the usual Gauss-Bonnet term for vanishing Weyl connection, i.e., when only the Levi-Civita part of the connection is present. We expand the action in terms of Riemannian quantities and obtain vector-tensor theories. We find that all the free parameters only appear in the kinetic term of the vector field so that two branches are possible: one with a propagating vector field and another one where the vector field does not propagate. We focus on the propagating case. We find that in 4 dimensions, the theory is equivalent to Einstein's gravity plus a Proca field. This field is naturally decoupled from matter so that it represents a natural candidate for dark matter. Also in d=4, we discuss a non-trivial cubic term in the curvature that can be constructed without spoiling the second order nature of the field equations because it leads to the vector-tensor Horndeski interaction. In arbitrary dimensions, the theory becomes more involved. We show that, even though the vector field presents kinetic interactions which do not have U(1) symmetry, there are no additional propagating degrees of freedom with respect to the usual massive case. Interestingly, we show that this relies on the fact that the corresponding Stueckelberg field belongs to a specific class within the general Horndeski theories. Finally, since Weyl geometries are the natural ground to build scale invariant theories, we apply the usual Weyl-gauging in order to make the Horndeski action locally scale invariant and discuss on new terms that can be added.

A model independent study of dark matter production in the pre-bounce contraction and the post-bounce expansion epochs of the bounce universe reveals a new venue for achieving the observed relic abundance of our present universe, in which a significantly smaller amount of dark matter with a smaller cross section -- as compared to the prediction of Standard Cosmology -- is produced and carries the information about the bounce universe evolution. Once the values of dark matter mass and cross section are obtained by direct detection in laboratories, this alternative route becomes a signature of the bounce universe scenario. ",

For a simple model we show by explicit calculation that the low-energy action obtained from a sensible UV completion need not take the restrictive form required to obtain only second-order field equations, and we clarify why runaway solutions are nevertheless typically not a problem for the EFT. Although our results will not be surprising to many, to our knowledge they are only mentioned tangentially in the EFT literature, which (with a few exceptions) largely addresses time-independent situations.

The potential of the scalar field is the $n$ degree monomial or polynomial. We describe several qualitatively different types of dynamics depending on values of power indices $N$ and $n$. We identify that three main possible pictures correspond to $n<N$, $N<n<2N$ and $n>2N$ cases. Some special features connected with the important cases of $N=n$ (including the quadratic potential with quadratic coupling) and $n=2N$ (which shares its asymptotics with the potential of the Higgs-driven inflation) are described separately. A global qualitative analysis allows us to cover the most interesting cases of small $N$ and $n$ by a limiting number of phase-space diagrams.

This reduction can happen near the Planck scale, or much before, the dimensions that are reduced can be effective, spectral, topological or the usual dimensions, but many things points toward the fact that the high energy theories appear to propagate in a lower dimensional space, rather than a higher dimensional one. We will concentrate on a particular scenario of \"vanishing\" or \"evolving dimensions\" where the dimensions open up as we increase the length scale that we are probing, but will also mention related models that point to the same direction, i.e. the causal dynamical triangulation, asymptotic safety, as well as evidence coming from a non-commutative quantum theories, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and phenomenon of \"asymptotic silence\". It is intriguing that experimental evidence for the high energy dimensional reduction may already exists - a statistically significant planar alignment of events with energies higher than TeV has been observed in high altitude cosmic ray experiments. A convincing evidence for dimensional reduction may be found in future in collider experiments and gravity waves observatories. ",

Here, analogous objects are also shown to exist around rotating (Kerr) black holes, as non-linear bound states of a test scalar field. We dub such configurations Q-clouds. We focus on a complex massive scalar field with quartic plus hexic self-interactions. Without the self-interactions, linear clouds have been shown to exist, in synchronous rotation with the black hole horizon, along 1-dimensional subspaces - existence lines - of the Kerr 2-dimensional parameter space. They are zero modes of the superradiant instability. Non-linear Q-clouds, on the other hand, are also in synchronous rotation with the black hole horizon; but they exist on a 2-dimensional subspace, delimited by a minimal horizon angular velocity and by an appropriate existence line, wherein the non-linear terms become irrelevant and the Q-cloud reduces to a linear cloud. Thus, Q-clouds provide an example of scalar bound states around Kerr black holes which, generically, are not zero modes of the superradiant instability. We describe some physical properties of Q-clouds, whose backreaction leads to a new family of hairy black holes, continuously connected to the Kerr family. ",

Classically, unimodular gravity is simply a gauge fixed version of General Relativity (GR), and as such it yields identical dynamics and physical predictions. We clarify this and explain why there is no sense in which it can \"bring a new perspective\" to the cosmological constant problem. The quantum equivalence between unimodular gravity and GR is more of a subtle question, but we present an argument that suggests one can always maintain the equivalence up to arbitrarily high momenta. As a corollary to this, we argue that whenever inequivalence is seen at the quantum level, that just means we have defined two different quantum theories that happen to share a classical limit. ",

The questions one has to answer are whether the EOS universality is preserved in this regime and what are the deviations from general relativity. Our results show that the $\\bar{I}-\\bar{Q}$ relation is nearly EOS independent for scalarized rapidly rotating stars, but the differences with pure Einstein's theory increase compared to the slowly rotating case. In general, smaller negative values of the scalar field coupling parameters $\\beta$ lead to larger deviations, but these deviations are below the expected accuracy of the future astrophysical observations if one considers values of $\\beta$ in agreement with the current observational constraint. An important remark is that although the normalized $\\bar{I}-\\bar{Q}$ relation is quite similar for scalar-tensor theories and general relativity, the unnormalized moment of inertia and quadrupole moment can be very different in the two theories. This demonstrates that although the $\\bar{I}-\\bar{Q}$ relations are potentially very useful for some purposes, they might not serve us well when trying to distinguish between different theories of gravity.

    "abstract": "  We analyze causal structures in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. It is known that Gauss-Bonnet gravity potentially has superluminal propagation of gravitons due to its noncanonical kinetic terms. In a theory with superluminal modes, an analysis of causality based on null curves makes no sense, and thus, we need to analyze them in a different way. In this paper, using the method of the characteristics, we analyze the causal structure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We have the result that, on a Killing horizon, gravitons can propagate in the null direction tangent to the Killing horizon. Therefore, a Killing horizon can be a causal edge as in the case of general relativity, i.e. a Killing horizon is the \"event horizon\" in the sense of causality. We also analyze causal structures on nonstationary solutions with $(D-2)$-dimensional maximal symmetry, including spherically symmetric and flat spaces. If the geometrical null energy condition, $R_{AB}N^AN^B \\ge 0$ for any null vector $N^A$, is satisfied, the radial velocity of gravitons must be less than or equal to that of light. However, if the geometrical null energy condition is violated, gravitons can propagate faster than light. Hence, on an evaporating black hole where the geometrical null energy condition is expected not to hold, classical gravitons can escape from the \"black hole\" defined with null curves. That is, the causal structures become nontrivial. It may be one of the possible solutions for the information loss paradox of evaporating black holes. ",

    "abstract": "  We present the first results of an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves from unknown spinning neutron stars in binary systems using LIGO and Virgo data. Using a specially developed analysis program, the TwoSpect algorithm, the search was carried out on data from the sixth LIGO Science Run and the second and third Virgo Science Runs. The search covers a range of frequencies from 20 Hz to 520 Hz, a range of orbital periods from 2 to ~2,254 h and a frequency- and period-dependent range of frequency modulation depths from 0.277 to 100 mHz. This corresponds to a range of projected semi-major axes of the orbit from ~0.6e-3 ls to ~6,500 ls assuming the orbit of the binary is circular. While no plausible candidate gravitational wave events survive the pipeline, upper limits are set on the analyzed data. The most sensitive 95% confidence upper limit obtained on gravitational wave strain is 2.3e-24 at 217 Hz, assuming the source waves are circularly polarized. Although this search has been optimized for circular binary orbits, the upper limits obtained remain valid for orbital eccentricities as large as 0.9. In addition, upper limits are placed on continuous gravitational wave emission from the low-mass x-ray binary Scorpius X-1 between 20 Hz and 57.25 Hz. ",

We show how a local 2-dimensional conformal symmetry arises at each puncture inducing an infinite set of new observables localized at the horizon which satisfy a Kac-Moody algebra. By means of the isolated horizon boundary conditions, we represent the gravitational fluxes degrees of freedom in terms of the zero modes of the Kac-Moody algebra defined on the boundary of a punctured disk. In this way, our construction encodes a precise notion of CFT/gravity correspondence. The higher modes in the algebra represent new nongeometric charges which can be represented in terms of free matter field degrees of freedom. When computing the CFT partition function of the system, these new states induce an extra degeneracy factor, representing the density of horizon states at a given energy level, which reproduces the Bekenstein's holographic bound for an imaginary Immirzi parameter. This allows us to recover the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula without the large quantum gravity corrections associated with the number of punctures. ",

Indeed, the origin of these supermassive objects is not well understood, topological non-trivial structures like wormholes are allowed both in general relativity and in alternative theories of gravity, and current observations cannot rule out such a possibility. In a few years, the VLTI instrument GRAVITY will have the capability to image blobs of plasma orbiting near the innermost stable circular orbit of SgrA$^*$, the supermassive black hole candidate in the Milky Way. The secondary image of a hot spot orbiting around a wormhole is substantially different from that of a hot spot around a black hole, because the photon capture sphere of the wormhole is much smaller. The radius of the photon capture sphere is independent of the hot spot model, and therefore its possible detection, which is observationally challenging but not out of reach, can unambiguously test if the center of our Galaxy harbors a wormhole rather than a black hole.

    "abstract": "  The gravitational properties of astrophysical objects depend sensitively on their internal structure. In Newtonian theory, the gravitational potential of a rotating star can be fully described by an infinite number of multipole moments of its mass distribution. Recently, this infinite number of moments for uniformly-rotating stars were shown semi-analytically to be expressible in terms of just the first three: the mass, the spin, and the quadrupole moment of the star. The relations between the various lower multipole moments were additionally shown to depend weakly on the equation of state, when considering neutron stars and assuming single polytropic equations of state. Here we extend this result in two ways. First, we show that the universality also holds for realistic equations of state, thus relaxing the need to use single polytropes. Second, we derive purely analytical universal relations by perturbing the equations of structure about an $n=0$ polytrope that reproduce semi-analytic results to $\\mathcal{O}(1\\%)$. We also find that the linear-order perturbation vanishes in some cases, which provides further evidence and a deeper understanding of the universality. ",

The most novel feature of our formalism is the introduction, and systematic use, of the (gauge-invariant) concept of {\\it centrifugal radius} $r_{c}$. In the spinning small mass-ratio limit, the main radial potential expressed in terms of $r_{c}$ differs very little (and only multiplicatively so) from the usual Schwarzschild potential $1-2M/r_{c}$. This motivates a new, multiplicative way of blending finite-mass-ratio deformations with spin-deformations. In the present exploratory work we consider a minimal version of our spinning EOB model (containing essentially only two adjustable parameters: one in the Hamiltonian and one in the waveform) and calibrate its (dominant mode) waveform against a sample of fifteen equal-mass, equal-spin waveforms produced by the SXS collaboration, and covering the dimensionless spin range $-0.95\\leq \\chi \\leq +0.98$.

The self-force is first evaluated numerically, and next presented as an analytical expansion in powers of R/r, with R denoting the event-horizon radius. The power series is then summed to yield a closed-form expression. Unlike its four-dimensional version, the self-force features a dependence on a regularization parameter s that can be interpreted as the particle's radius. The self-force is repulsive at large distances, and its behavior is related to a model according to which the force results from a gravitational interaction between the black hole and the distribution of electrostatic field energy attached to the particle. The model, however, is shown to become inadequate as r becomes comparable to R, where the self-force changes sign and becomes attractive. We also calculate the self-force acting on a particle with a scalar charge, which we find to be everywhere attractive.

    "abstract": "  A key result of isotropic loop quantum cosmology is the existence of a quantum bounce which occurs when the energy density of the matter field approaches a universal maximum close to the Planck density. Though the bounce has been exhibited in various matter models, due to severe computational challenges some important questions have so far remained unaddressed. These include the demonstration of the bounce for widely spread states, its detailed properties for the states when matter field probes regions close to the Planck volume and the reliability of the continuum effective spacetime description in general. In this manuscript we rigorously answer these questions using the Chimera numerical scheme for the isotropic spatially flat model sourced with a massless scalar field. We show that as expected from an exactly solvable model, the quantum bounce is a generic feature of states even with a very wide spread, and for those which bounce much closer to the Planck volume. We perform a detailed analysis of the departures from the effective description and find some expected, and some surprising results. At a coarse level of description, the effective dynamics can be regarded as a good approximation to the underlying quantum dynamics unless the states correspond to small scalar field momenta, in which case they bounce closer to the Planck volume, or are very widely spread. Quantifying the amount of discrepancy between the quantum and the effective dynamics, we find that the departure between them depends in a subtle and non-monotonic way on the field momentum and different fluctuations. Interestingly, the departures are generically found to be such that the effective dynamics overestimates the spacetime curvature, and underestimates the volume at the bounce. ",

Expanding the Horndeski action to second order in perturbations and eliminating auxiliary variables, we derive the quadratic action for even-parity perturbations written solely in terms of two dynamical variables. The two perturbations can be interpreted as the gravitational and scalar waves. Correspondingly, we obtain two conditions to evade ghosts and two conditions for the absence of gradient instabilities. Only one in each pair of conditions yields a new stability criterion, as the conditions derived from the stability of the gravitational-wave degree of freedom coincide with those in the odd-parity sector. Similarly, the propagation speed of one of the two modes is the same as that for the odd-parity mode, while the other differs in general from them. Our result is applicable to all the theories of gravitation with an extra single scalar degree of freedom such as the Brans-Dicke theory, $f(R)$ models, and Galileon gravity. ",

Particular attention is devoted to constraints from the recent observational determination of the redshift of the cosmological deceleration-acceleration transition. Making use of the fact that the Ricci scalar is a function of redshift $z$ in these models, $\\mathcal {R=R}(z)$, and so is $f(z)$, we use cosmography to relate a $f(z)$ test function evaluated at higher $z$ to late-time cosmographic bounds. First, we consider a model independent procedure to build up a numerical $f(z)$ by requiring that at $z=0$ the corresponding cosmological model reduces to standard $\\Lambda$CDM. We then infer late-time observational constraints on $f(z)$ in terms of bounds on the Taylor expansion cosmographic coefficients. In doing so we parameterize possible departures from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model in terms of a two-parameter logarithmic correction. The physical meaning of the two parameters is also discussed in terms of the post Newtonian approximation. Second, we provide numerical estimates of the cosmographic series terms by using Type Ia supernova apparent magnitude data and Hubble parameter measurements. Finally, we use these estimates to bound the two parameters of the logarithmic correction. We find that the deceleration parameter in our model changes sign at a redshift consistent with what is observed. ",

In this review, we describe how the emergent gravity paradigm provides a new insight and a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem. After reviewing the necessary background material, we identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for solving the cosmological constant problem. We show that these conditions are naturally satisfied in the emergent gravity paradigm in which (i) the field equations of gravity are invariant under the addition of a constant to the matter Lagrangian and (ii) the cosmological constant appears as an integration constant in the solution. The numerical value of this integration constant can be related to another dimensionless number (called CosMIn) that counts the number of modes inside a Hubble volume that cross the Hubble radius during the radiation and the matter dominated epochs of the universe. The emergent gravity paradigm suggests that CosMIn has the numerical value $4 \\pi$, which, in turn, leads to the correct, observed value of the cosmological constant. Further, the emergent gravity paradigm provides an alternative perspective on cosmology and interprets the expansion of the universe itself as a quest towards holographic equipartition. We discuss the implications of this novel and alternate description of cosmology. ",

The explicit nonminimal couplings, for instance, between an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature $R$ and the Lagrangian density of matter, induces a non-vanishing covariant derivative of the energy-momentum tensor, implying non-geodesic motion and consequently leads to the appearance of an extra force. Applied to the cosmological context, these curvature-matter couplings lead to interesting phenomenology, where one can obtain a unified description of the cosmological epochs. We also consider the possibility that the behavior of the galactic flat rotation curves can be explained in the framework of the curvature-matter coupling models, where the extra-terms in the gravitational field equations modify the equations of motion of test particles, and induce a supplementary gravitational interaction. In addition to this, these models are extremely useful for describing dark energy-dark matter interactions, and for explaining the late-time cosmic acceleration. ",

The investigated parameters/quantities are the evolution of the Hubble parameter and its inverse, the \"weight function\", the ratio of the matter density to the dark energy density and its time variation, the deceleration, the jerk and the snap parameters, and the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy.

However, derivatives of $g_{ab}$ are not close to derivatives of $g_{ab}^{(0)}$, so there can be significant differences in the behavior of geodesics and huge differences in curvature. Consequently, observable quantities in the actual universe may differ significantly from the corresponding observables in the FLRW model. Nevertheless, as we shall review here, we have proven general results showing that---within the framework of our approach to treating backreaction---the large matter inhomogeneities that occur on small scales cannot produce significant effects on large scales, so $g_{ab}^{(0)}$ satisfies Einstein's equation with the averaged stress-energy tensor of matter as its source. We discuss the flaws in some other approaches that have suggested that large backreaction effects may occur. As we also will review here, with a suitable \"dictionary,\" Newtonian cosmologies provide excellent approximations to cosmological solutions to Einstein's equation (with dust and a cosmological constant) on all scales.

Here we take a Bayesian approach and introduce a multi-component, variable dimension, parameterized noise model that explicitly accounts for non-stationarity and non-Gaussianity in data from interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Instrumental transients (glitches) and burst sources of gravitational waves are modeled using a Morlet-Gabor continuous wavelet frame. The number and placement of the wavelets is determined by a trans-dimensional Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The Gaussian component of the noise and sharp line features in the noise spectrum are modeled using the BayesLine algorithm, which operates in concert with the wavelet model. ",

    "abstract": "  Soon after the discovery of the Kerr metric, Penrose realized that superradiance can be exploited to extract energy from black holes. The original idea (involving the breakup of a single particle) yields only modest energy gains. A variant of the Penrose process consists of particle collisions in the ergoregion. The collisional Penrose process has been explored recently in the context of dark matter searches, with the conclusion that the ratio $\\eta$ between the energy of post-collision particles detected at infinity and the energy of the colliding particles should be modest ($\\eta \\lesssim 1.5$). Schnittman has shown that these studies underestimated the maximum efficiency by about one order of magnitude (i.e., $\\eta \\lesssim 15$). In this work we show that particle collisions in the vicinity of rapidly rotating black holes can produce high-energy ejecta and result in high efficiencies under much more generic conditions. The astrophysical likelihood of these events deserves further scrutiny, but our study hints at the tantalizing possibility that the collisional Penrose process may power gamma rays and ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

Anisotropy is known to affect the bulk properties of nonrotating neutron stars in General Relativity. In this paper we study the effects of anisotropy on slowly rotating stars in General Relativity. We also consider one of the most popular extensions of Einstein's theory, namely scalar-tensor theories allowing for spontaneous scalarization (a phase transition similar to spontaneous magnetization in ferromagnetic materials). Anisotropy affects the moment of inertia of neutron stars (a quantity that could potentially be measured in binary pulsar systems) in both theories. We find that the effects of scalarization increase (decrease) when the tangential pressure is bigger (smaller) than the radial pressure, and we present a simple criterion to determine the onset of scalarization by linearizing the scalar-field equation. Our calculations suggest that binary pulsar observations may constrain the degree of anisotropy or even, more optimistically, provide evidence for anisotropy in neutron star cores. ",

    "abstract": "  Extending previous work by a number of authors, we have recently presented a new approach in which the detection of gravitational waves from merging neutron star binaries can be used to determine the equation of state of matter at nuclear density and hence the structure of neutron stars. In particular, after performing a large number of numerical-relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear equations of state, we have found that the post-merger emission is characterized by two distinct and robust spectral features. While the high-frequency peak was already shown to be associated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by the merger and to depend on the equation of state, we have highlighted that the low-frequency peak is related to the merger process and to the total compactness of the stars in the binary. This relation is essentially universal and provides a powerful tool to set tight constraints on the equation of state. We here provide additional information on the extensive analysis performed, illustrating the methods used, the tests considered, as well as the robustness of the results. We also discuss additional relations that can be deduced when exploring the data and how these correlate with various properties of the binary. Finally, we present a simple mechanical toy model that explains the main spectral features of the post-merger signal and can even reproduce analytically the complex waveforms emitted right after the merger.

Here we show the complete physical equivalence of the two results, thereby we first prove the equivalence of the ADM Hamiltonian and the Effective Field Theory approaches at next-to-next-to-leading order with the inclusion of spins. The main difficulty in the spinning sectors, which also prescribes the manner in which the comparison of the two results is tackled here, is the existence of redundant unphysical spin degrees of freedom, associated with the spin gauge choice of a point within the extended spinning object for its representative worldline. After gauge fixing and eliminating the unphysical degrees of freedom of the spin and its conjugate at the level of the action, we arrive at curved spacetime generalizations of the Newton-Wigner variables in closed form, which can also be used to obtain further Hamiltonians, based on an Effective Field Theory formulation and computation. Finally, we make use of our validated result to provide gauge invariant relations among the binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital frequency of an inspiralling binary with generic compact spinning components to fourth post-Newtonian order, including all known sectors up to date.

Recently, Cardoso, Pani and Rico have proposed a more general parametrization. The aim of the present paper is to study this new metric in a specific context, namely the thermal spectrum of geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disks. The most relevant finding is that the spacetime geometry around objects that look like very fast-rotating Kerr black holes may still have large deviations from the Kerr solution. This was not the case with the Johannsen-Psaltis metric, which means the latter was missing an important class of non-Kerr spacetimes. ",

The moment of inertia and its dependence on the stellar mass and the $R$-squared gravity parameter $a$ is also examined in details. We find that the neutron star moment of inertia for large values of the parameter $a$ can be up to $30\\%$ larger compared to the corresponding general relativistic models. This is much higher than the change in the maximum mass induced by $R$-squared gravity and is beyond the EOS uncertainty.

    "abstract": "  Relativistic contributions to the dynamics of structure formation come in a variety of forms, and can potentially give corrections to the standard picture on typical scales of 100 Mpc. These corrections cannot be obtained by Newtonian numerical simulations, so it is important to accurately estimate the magnitude of these relativistic effects. Density fluctuations couple to produce a background of gravitational waves, which is larger than any primordial background. A similar interaction produces a much larger spectrum of vector modes which represent the frame-dragging rotation of spacetime. These can change the metric at the percent level in the concordance model at scales below the equality scale. Vector modes modify the lensing of background galaxies by large-scale structure. This gives in principle the exciting possibility of measuring relativistic frame dragging effects on cosmological scales. The effects of the non-linear tensor and vector modes on the cosmic convergence are computed and compared to first-order lensing contributions from density fluctuations, Doppler lensing, and smaller Sachs-Wolfe effects. The lensing from gravitational waves is negligible so we concentrate on the vector modes. We show the relative importance of this for future surveys such as Euclid and SKA. We find that these non-linear effects only marginally affect the overall weak lensing signal so they can safely be neglected in most analyses, though are still much larger than the linear Sachs-Wolfe terms. The second-order vector contribution can dominate the first-order Doppler lensing term at moderate redshifts and are actually more important for survey geometries like the SKA. ",

Choosing initial conditions for geodesic motion leads to solutions for which the deviations are entirely due to the spin-curvature force, and one finds that the spinning particle position for a given fixed total spin oscillates roughly within an ellipse in the plane perpendicular to the motion, while the azimuthal motion undergoes similar oscillations plus an additional secular drift which varies with spin orientation.

Here, we present a robust method to identify quasi-normal mode excitations beyond the fundamentals within currently available numerical relativity waveforms. In applying this method to waveforms of initially non-spinning black hole binaries, of mass ratios 1 to 15, we find not only the fundamental quasi-normal mode amplitudes, but also overtones, and evidence for 2nd order quasi-normal modes. We find that the mass-ratio dependence of quasi-normal mode excitation is very well modeled by a Post-Newtonian like sum in symmetric mass ratio. Concurrently, we find that the mass ratio dependence of some quasi-normal modes is qualitatively different from their Post-Newtonian inspired counterparts, suggesting that the imprints of nonlinear merger are more evident in some modes than in others. We present new fitting formulas for the related quasi-normal mode excitations, as well as for remnant black hole spin and mass.

For effective, dimensionless spin values above $0.2$, the use of non-spinning or spin-aligned templates for detection purposes will result in a loss of up to $30%$ of all events, while in the case of the double-precessing model, this never exceeds $6%$. Moreover, even for signals from systems with small spins, non-spinning and spin-aligned templates introduce large biases in the extracted masses and spins. The use of a model that encodes spin-induced precession effects, such as the double-precessing model, improves the mass and spin extraction by up to an order of magnitude. The additional information encoded in the spin-orbit interaction is invaluable if one wishes to extract the maximum amount of information from gravitational wave signals. ",

    "abstract": "  The Problem of Time (PoT) is a multi-faceted conceptual incompatibility between various areas of Theoretical Physics. Whilst usually stated as between GR and QM, in fact 8/9ths of it is already present at the classical level. Thus we adopt a `top down' classical and then quantum approach. I consider a local resolution to the Problem of Time that is Machian, which was previously realized for relational triangle and minisuperspace models. This resolution has three levels: classical, semiclassical and combined semiclassical-histories-records. This article's specific model is a slightly inhomogeneous cosmology considered for now at the classical level. This is motivated by how the inhomogeneous fluctuations that underlie structure formation - galaxies and CMB hotspots - might have been seeded by quantum cosmological fluctuations, as magnified by some inflationary mechanism. In particular, I consider perturbations about $\\mathbb{S}^3$ case of this up to second order -- which has a number of parallels with the Halliwell-Hawking model but has a number of conceptual differences and useful upgrades. The article's main features are that the elimination part of the model's thin sandwich is straightforward, but the modewise split of the constraints fail to be first-class constraints. Thus the elimination part only arises as an intermediate geometry between superspace and Riem. The reduced geometries have surprising singularities influenced by the matter content of the universe, though the $N$-body problem anticipates these with its collinear singularities. I also give a `basis set' of Kuchar beables for this model arena. ",

    "abstract": "  A compact object moving in curved spacetime interacts with its own gravitational field. This leads to both dissipative and conservative corrections to the motion, which can be interpreted as a self-force acting on the object. The original formalism describing this self-force relied heavily on the Green function of the linear differential operator that governs gravitational perturbations. However, because the global calculation of Green functions in non-trivial black hole spacetimes has been an open problem until recently, alternative methods were established to calculate self-force effects using sophisticated regularization techniques that avoid the computation of the global Green function. We present a method for calculating the self-force that employs the global Green function and is therefore closely modeled after the original self-force expressions. Our quantitative method involves two stages: (i) numerical approximation of the retarded Green function in the background spacetime; (ii) evaluation of convolution integrals along the worldline of the object. This novel approach can be used along arbitrary worldlines, including those currently inaccessible to more established computational techniques. Furthermore, it yields geometrical insight into the contributions to self-interaction from curved geometry (back-scattering) and trapping of null geodesics. We demonstrate the method on the motion of a scalar charge in Schwarzschild spacetime. This toy model retains the physical history-dependence of the self-force but avoids gauge issues and allows us to focus on basic principles. We compute the self-field and self-force for many worldlines including accelerated circular orbits, eccentric orbits at the separatrix, and radial infall. This method, closely modeled after the original formalism, provides a promising complementary approach to the self-force problem. ",

    "abstract": "  We study the mechanisms of the gravitational collapse of the Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter halos, described by the zero temperature time-dependent nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (the Gross-Pitaevskii equation), with repulsive inter-particle interactions. By using a variational approach, and by choosing an appropriate trial wave function, we reformulate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with spherical symmetry as Newton's equation of motion for a particle in an effective potential, which is determined by the zero point kinetic energy, the gravitational energy, and the particles interaction energy, respectively. The velocity of the condensate is proportional to the radial distance, with a time dependent proportionality function. The equation of motion of the collapsing dark matter condensate is studied by using both analytical and numerical methods. The collapse of the condensate ends with the formation of a stable configuration, corresponding to the minimum of the effective potential. The radius and the mass of the resulting dark matter object are obtained, as well as the collapse time of the condensate. The numerical values of these global astrophysical quantities, characterizing condensed dark matter systems, strongly depend on the two parameters describing the condensate, the mass of the dark matter particle, and of the scattering length, respectively. The stability of the condensate under small perturbations is also studied, and the oscillations frequency of the halo is obtained. Hence these results show that the gravitational collapse of the condensed dark matter halos can lead to the formation of stable astrophysical systems with both galactic and stellar sizes. ",

We show that it is possible to extend this setup to lower dimensions as well, i.e. there is a self-consistent embedding of a 3D brane into a 4D brane, which is itself embedded in a 5D bulk and so on.

These techniques mitigate the problematic increase of search-dimensionality with the size of the pulsar array which arises from having to include an extra parameter per pulsar as the array is expanded. This extra parameter corresponds to searching over the phase of the gravitational-wave as it propagates past each pulsar so that we can coherently include the pulsar-term in our search strategies. Our techniques make the analysis tractable with powerful evidence-evaluation packages like MultiNest. We find good agreement of our techniques with the parameter-estimation and Bayes factor evaluation performed with full signal templates, and conclude that these techniques make excellent first-cut tools for detection and characterisation of continuous gravitational-wave signals with pulsar timing arrays. Crucially, at low to moderate signal-to-noise ratios the factor by which the analysis is sped up can be > 100, permitting rigorous programs of systematic injection and recovery of signals to establish robust detection criteria within a Bayesian formalism.

However, this can hardly be a truly convincing explanation, as an expanding universe is not expected to have a static vacuum energy density. So, it must be an approximation. This reminds us of the so-called fundamental \"constants\" of nature. Recent and past measurements of the fine structure constant and of the proton-electron mass ratio suggest that basic quantities of the standard model, such as the QCD scale parameter $\\Lambda_{QCD}$, might not be conserved in the course of the cosmological evolution. The masses of the nucleons and of the atomic nuclei would be time-evolving. This can be consistent with General Relativity provided the vacuum energy itself is a dynamical quantity. Another framework realizing this possibility is QHD (Quantum Haplodynamics), a fundamental theory of bound states. If one assumes that its running couplings unify at the Planck scale and that such scale changes slowly with cosmic time, the masses of the nucleons and of the DM particles, including the cosmological term, will evolve with time. This could explain the dark energy of the universe. ",

While it is clear that both parametrizations are mathematically equivalent at the level of the classical action, the question about their mathematical equivalence at the quantum level as well as their physical equivalence is still a matter of debate in cosmology. We analyze whether the mathematical equivalence still holds when the first quantum corrections are taken into account. We therefore explicitly calculate the one-loop divergences in both parametrizations by using the generalized Schwinger-DeWitt algorithm and compare both results. We find that the quantum corrections do not coincide and hence induce an off-shell dependence on the parametrization. An explanation of the origin of this frame dependence is suggested to be found within a geometrical approach in the more general field theoretical framework. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of this analysis and its consequences for cosmology. ",

Here we present a detailed study of the evolution of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system in a cavity, with different types of deformations of the spectrum, including a mass term for the scalar and Neumann conditions at the boundary. We provide numerical evidence that gravitational collapse always occurs, at least for amplitudes that are three orders of magnitude smaller than Choptuik's critical value and corresponding to more than $10^5$ reflections before collapse. The collapse time scales as the inverse square of the initial amplitude in the small-amplitude limit. In addition, we find that fields with nonresonant spectrum collapse earlier than in the fully-resonant case, a result that is at odds with the current understanding of the process. Energy is transferred through a direct cascade to high frequencies when the spectrum is resonant, but we observe both direct- and inverse-cascade effects for nonresonant spectra. Our results indicate that a fully-resonant spectrum might not be a crucial ingredient of the conjectured turbulent instability and that other mechanisms might be relevant. We discuss how a definitive answer to this problem is essentially impossible within the present framework. ",

As an added benefit, this also removes the (as of yet unobserved) massless Goldstino associated to global supersymmetry breaking from the particle spectrum. In this review we detail the pertinent properties and outline previously hidden details of the various steps required in this context in order to make contact with current inflationary phenomenology. The class of models of SUGRA we use to exemplify our approach are minimal four-dimensional N=1 supergravity and conformal extensions thereof (with broken conformal symmetry). Therein, the gravitino condensate itself can play the role of the inflaton, however the requirement of slow-roll necessitates unnaturally large values of the wave-function renormalisation. Nevertheless, there is an alternative scenario that may provide Starobinsky-type inflation, occurring in the broken-SUGRA phase around the non-trivial minima of the gravitino-condensate effective potential. In this scenario higher curvature corrections to the effective action, crucial for the onset of an inflationary phase, arise as a result of integrating out massive quantum gravitino fields in the path integral. The latter scenario is compatible with Planck satellite phenomenology but not with BICEP2 data. ",

Without HD this system describes irrotational dust - Dark Matter (DM) as we see it on cosmologically large scales. DM particles correspond to the shift-charges - Noether charges of the shifts in the field space. Higher derivative corrections usually describe a deviation from the thermodynamical equilibrium in the relativistic hydrodynamics. Thus we show that mimetic matter with HD corresponds to an imperfect DM which: i) renormalises the Newton's constant in the Friedmann equations, ii) has zero pressure when there is no extra matter in the universe, iii) survives the inflationary expansion which puts the system on a dynamical attractor with a vanishing shift-charge, iv) perfectly tracks any external matter on this attractor, v) can become the main (and possibly the only) source of DM, provided the shift-symmetry in the HD terms is broken during some small time interval in the radiation domination era. In the second part of the paper we present a hydrodynamical description of general anisotropic and inhomogeneous configurations of the system. This imperfect mimetic fluid has an energy flow in the field's rest frame. We find that in the Eckart and in the Landau-Lifshitz frames the mimetic fluid possesses nonvanishing vorticity appearing already at the first order in the HD. Thus, the structure formation and gravitational collapse should proceed in a rather different fashion from the simple irrotational DM models. ",

    "abstract": "  Forty years after the discovery of Hawking radiation, its exact nature remains elusive. If Hawking radiation does not carry any information out from the ever shrinking black hole, it seems that unitarity is violated once the black hole completely evaporates. On the other hand, attempts to recover information via quantum entanglement lead to the firewall controversy. Amid the confusions, the possibility that black hole evaporation stops with a \"remnant\" has remained unpopular and is often dismissed due to some \"undesired properties\" of such an object. Nevertheless, as in any scientific debate, the pros and cons of any proposal must be carefully scrutinized. We fill in the void of the literature by providing a timely review of various types of black hole remnants, and provide some new thoughts regarding the challenges that black hole remnants face in the context of information loss paradox and its latest incarnation, namely the firewall controversy. The importance of understanding the role of curvature singularity is also emphasized, after all there remains a possibility that singularity cannot be cured even by quantum gravity. In this context a black hole remnant conveniently serves as a cosmic censor. We conclude that a remnant remains a possible end state of Hawking evaporation, and if it contains large interior geometry, may help to ameliorate information loss and the firewall paradox. We hope that this will raise some interests in the community to investigate remnants more critically but also more thoroughly. ",

    "abstract": "  We present results of a search for continuously-emitted gravitational radiation, directed at the brightest low-mass X-ray binary, Scorpius X-1. Our semi-coherent analysis covers 10 days of LIGO S5 data ranging from 50-550 Hz, and performs an incoherent sum of coherent $\\mathcal{F}$-statistic power distributed amongst frequency-modulated orbital sidebands. All candidates not removed at the veto stage were found to be consistent with noise at a 1% false alarm rate. We present Bayesian 95% confidence upper limits on gravitational-wave strain amplitude using two different prior distributions: a standard one, with no a priori assumptions about the orientation of Scorpius X-1; and an angle-restricted one, using a prior derived from electromagnetic observations. Median strain upper limits of 1.3e-24 and 8e-25 are reported at 150 Hz for the standard and angle-restricted searches respectively. This proof of principle analysis was limited to a short observation time by unknown effects of accretion on the intrinsic spin frequency of the neutron star, but improves upon previous upper limits by factors of ~1.4 for the standard, and 2.3 for the angle-restricted search at the sensitive region of the detector.

    "abstract": "  We present numerical simulations of binary neutron star mergers, comparing irrotational binaries to binaries of NSs rotating aligned to the orbital angular momentum. For the first time, we study spinning BNSs employing nuclear physics equations of state, namely the ones of Lattimer and Swesty as well as Shen, Horowitz, and Teige. We study mainly equal mass systems leading to a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS), and analyze in detail its structure and dynamics. In order to exclude gauge artifacts, we introduce a novel coordinate system used for post-processing. The results for our equal mass models show that the strong radial oscillations of the HMNS modulate the instantaneous frequency of the gravitational wave (GW) signal to an extend that leads to separate peaks in the corresponding Fourier spectrum. In particular, the high frequency peaks which are often attributed to combination frequencies can also be caused by the modulation of the m=2 mode frequency in the merger phase. As a consequence for GW data analysis, the offset of the high frequency peak does not necessarily carry information about the radial oscillation frequency. Further, the low frequency peak in our simulations is dominated by the contribution of the plunge and the first 1-2 bounces. The amplitude of the radial oscillations depends on the initial NS spin, which therefore has a complicated influence on the spectrum. Another important result is that HMNSs can consist of a slowly rotating core with an extended, massive envelope rotating close to Keplerian velocity, contrary to the common notion that a rapidly rotating core is necessary to prevent a prompt collapse. Finally, our estimates on the amount of unbound matter show a dependency on the initial NS spin, explained by the influence of the latter on the amplitude of radial oscillations, which in turn cause shock waves.

    "abstract": "  The Horndeski theory of gravity is known as the most general scalar-tensor theory with second-order field equations. Recently, it was demonstrated by Gleyzes et al. that the Horndeski theory can further be generalized in such a way that although field equations are of third order, the number of propagating degrees of freedom remains the same. We study small-scale gravity in the generalized Horndeski theory, focusing in particular on an impact of the new derivative interaction beyond Horndeski on the Vainshtein screening mechanism. In the absence of the quintic galileon term and its generalization, we show that the new interaction does not change the qualitative behavior of gravity outside and near the source: the two metric potentials coincide, $\\Phi = \\Psi \\;(\\sim r^{-1})$, while the gravitational coupling is given by the cosmological one and hence is time-dependent in general. We find, however, that the gravitational field inside the source shows a novel behavior due to the interaction beyond Horndeski: the gravitational attraction is not determined solely from the enclosed mass and two potentials do not coincide, indicating breaking of the screening mechanism.

    "abstract": "  We calculate quasiequilibrium sequences of equal-mass, irrotational binary neutron stars (BNSs) in a scalar-tensor (ST) theory of gravity that admits dynamical scalarization. We model neutron stars with realistic equations of state (notably through piecewise polytropic equations of state). Using these quasiequilibrium sequences we compute the binary's scalar charge and binding energy versus orbital angular frequency. We find that the absolute value of the binding energy is smaller than in general relativity (GR), differing at most by ~14% at high frequencies for the cases considered. We use the newly computed binding energy and the balance equation to estimate the number of gravitational-wave (GW) cycles during the adiabatic, quasicircular inspiral stage up to the end of the sequence, which is the last stable orbit or the mass-shedding point, depending on which comes first. We find that, depending on the ST parameters, the number of GW cycles can be substantially smaller than in GR. In particular, we obtain that when dynamical scalarization sets in around a GW frequency of ~130 Hz, the sole inclusion of the ST binding energy causes a reduction of GW cycles from ~120 Hz up to the end of the sequence (~1200 Hz) of ~11% with respect to the GR case. We estimate that when the ST energy flux is also included the reduction in GW cycles becomes of ~24%. Quite interestingly, dynamical scalarization can produce a difference in the number of GW cycles with respect to the GR point-particle case that is much larger than the effect due to tidal interactions, which is on the order of only a few GW cycles. These results further clarify and confirm recent studies that have evolved BNSs either in full numerical relativity or in post-Newtonian theory, and point out the importance of developing accurate ST-theory waveforms for systems composed of strongly self-gravitating objects, such as BNSs.

    "abstract": "  We investigate the purely spatial Lagrangian coordinate transformation from the Lagrangian to the basic Eulerian frame. We demonstrate three techniques for extracting the relativistic displacement field from a given solution in the Lagrangian frame. These techniques are (a) from defining a local set of Eulerian coordinates embedded into the Lagrangian frame; (b) from performing a specific gauge transformation; and (c) from a fully non-perturbative approach based on the ADM split. The latter approach shows that this decomposition is not tied to a specific perturbative formulation for the solution of the Einstein equations. Rather, it can be defined at the level of the non-perturbative coordinate change from the Lagrangian to the Eulerian description. Studying such different techniques is useful because it allows us to compare and develop further the various approximation techniques available in the Lagrangian formulation. We find that one has to solve the gravitational wave equation in the relativistic analysis, otherwise the corresponding Newtonian limit will necessarily contain spurious non-propagating tensor artefacts at second order in the Eulerian frame. We also derive the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor in the Lagrangian frame, and find that it is not only excited by gravitational waves but also by tensor perturbations which are induced through the non-linear frame-dragging. We apply our findings to calculate for the first time the relativistic displacement field, up to second order, for a $\\Lambda$CDM Universe in the presence of a local primordial non-Gaussian component. Finally, we also comment on recent claims about whether mass conservation in the Lagrangian frame is violated. ",

    "abstract": "  The principles of quantum field theory in flat spacetime suggest that gravity is mediated by a massless particle with helicity $\\pm2$, the so-called graviton. It is regarded as textbook knowledge that, when the self-coupling of a particle with these properties is considered, the long-wavelength structure of such a nonlinear theory is fixed to be that of general relativity. However, here we show that these arguments conceal an implicit assumption which is surreptitiously motivated by the very knowledge of general relativity. This is shown by providing a counterexample: we revisit a nonlinear theory of gravity which is not structurally equivalent to general relativity and that, in the non-interacting limit, describes a free helicity $\\pm2$ graviton. We explicitly prove that this theory can be understood as the result of self-coupling in complete parallelism to the well-known case of general relativity. The assumption which was seen as natural in previous analyses but biased the result is pointed out. This special relativistic field theory of gravity implies the decoupling of vacuum zero-point energies of matter and passes all the known experimental tests in gravitation. ",

This new technique extends standard Taylor treatments, overcoming possible convergence issues at high redshifts plaguing standard cosmography. Indeed, we show that Pad\\'e expansions enable us to confidently use data over a larger interval with respect to the usual Taylor series. To show this property in detail, we propose several Pad\\'e expansions and we compare these approximations with cosmic data, thus obtaining cosmographic bounds from the observable universe for all cases. In particular, we fit Pad\\'e luminosity distances with observational data from different uncorrelated surveys. We employ union 2.1 supernova data, baryonic acoustic oscillation, Hubble space telescope measurements and differential age data. In so doing, we also demonstrate that the use of Pad\\'e approximants can improve the analyses carried out by introducing cosmographic auxiliary variables, i.e. a standard technique usually employed in cosmography in order to overcome the divergence problem. Moreover, for any drawback related to standard cosmography, we emphasize possible resolutions in the framework of Pad\\'e approximants. In particular, we investigate how to reduce systematics, how to overcome the degeneracy between cosmological coefficients, how to treat divergences and so forth. As a result, we show that cosmic bounds are actually refined through the use of Pad\\'e treatments and the thus derived best values of the cosmographic parameters show slight departures from the standard cosmological paradigm. Although all our results are perfectly consistent with the $\\Lambda$CDM model, evolving dark energy components different from a pure cosmological constant are not definitively ruled out. ",

More precisely, we introduce a two-parametric nonlinear electrodynamics defined in the more general, but less known, so-called $(\\mathcal{H},P)$-formalism and obtain a family of charged black hole solutions depending on two parameters. We also remark that the value of the dynamical exponent $z=D-2$ turns out to be critical in the sense that it yields asymptotically Lifshitz black holes with logarithmic decay supported by a particular logarithmic electrodynamics.

We show that the general $D$-dimensional quasinormal frequencies depend on the relation between the angular momentum quantum number, $\\ell$, and $D$. When $\\ell$ is a (non-negative) integer multiple of $D-3$, i.e $\\ell=p(D-3)$, we find an analytical quasinormal frequency formula adding a purely imaginary correction to the AdS normal frequencies. This is the case for all $\\ell$ modes in $D=4$. For general $D$ there are two more cases: i) when $\\ell$ obeys $\\ell=(p+\\frac{1}{2})(D-3)$, which can occur for odd $D$, we observe that the matching method fails, since the near and far region solutions have different functional dependences; ii) for all other cases, the analytical quasinormal frequency formula gives a complex correction to the AdS normal frequencies. Secondly, we perform a numerical calculation which confirms the analytical formulas obtained with the matching method and allows us to explore the case where that method failed. In the latter case, as in the former, we verify that all $\\ell$ modes for all $D$ may become superradiant, which contradicts a previous claim in the literature. ",

    "abstract": "  Given the extreme accuracy of modern space science, a precise relativistic modeling of observations is required. In particular, it is important to describe properly light propagation through the Solar System. For two decades, several modeling efforts based on the solution of the null geodesic equations have been proposed but they are mainly valid only for the first order Post-Newtonian approximation. However, with the increasing precision of ongoing space missions as Gaia, GAME, BepiColombo, JUNO or JUICE, we know that some corrections up to the second order have to be taken into account for future experiments. We present a procedure to compute the relativistic coordinate time delay, Doppler and astrometric observables avoiding the integration of the null geodesic equation. This is possible using the Time Transfer Function formalism, a powerful tool providing key quantities such as the time of flight of a light signal between two point-events and the tangent vector to its null-geodesic. Indeed we show how to compute the Time Transfer Functions and their derivatives (and thus range, Doppler and astrometric observables) up to the second post-Minkowskian order. We express these quantities as quadratures of some functions that depend only on the metric and its derivatives evaluated along a Minkowskian straight line. This method is particularly well adapted for numerical estimations. As an illustration, we provide explicit expressions in static and spherically symmetric space-time up to second post-Minkowskian order. Then we give the order of magnitude of these corrections for the range/Doppler on the BepiColombo mission and for astrometry in a GAME-like observation. ",

    "abstract": "  Gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by generic black-hole binaries show a rich structure that directly reflects the complex dynamics introduced by the precession of the orbital plane, which poses a real challenge to the development of generic waveform models. Recent progress in modelling these signals relies on an approximate decoupling between the non-precessing secular inspiral and a precession-induced rotation. However, the latter depends in general on all physical parameters of the binary which makes modelling efforts as well as understanding parameter-estimation prospects prohibitively complex. Here we show that the dominant precession effects can be captured by a reduced set of spin parameters. Specifically, we introduce a single \\emph{effective precession spin} parameter, $\\chi_p$, which is defined from the spin components that lie in the orbital plane at some (arbitrary) instant during the inspiral. We test the efficacy of this parameter by considering binary inspiral configurations specified by the physical parameters of a corresponding non-precessing-binary configuration (total mass, mass ratio, and spin components (anti-)parallel to the orbital angular momentum), plus the effective precession spin applied to the larger black hole. We show that for an overwhelming majority of random precessing configurations, the precession dynamics during the inspiral are well approximated by our equivalent configurations. Our results suggest that in the comparable-mass regime waveform models with only three spin parameters faithfully represent generic waveforms, which has practical implications for the prospects of GW searches, parameter estimation and the numerical exploration of the precessing-binary parameter space.

    "abstract": "  Recently, various observational data predict a possibility that inflation may naturally occur in a warm region. In this scenario, radiation is produced during the inflation epoch and reheating is avoided. The main question arises that what is the origin of warm inflation in 4D universe? We answer to this question in brane-antibrane system. We propose a model that allows all cosmological parameters like the scale factor a, the Hubble parameter H and phantom energy density depend on the equation of state parameter in transverse dimension between two branes. Thus, an enhancement in these parameters can be a signature of some evolutions in extra dimension. In our model, the expansion of 4D universe is controlled by the separation distance between branes and evolves from non-phantom phase to phantom one. Consequently, phantom-dominated era of the universe accelerates and ends up in big-rip singularity. Also, we show that as the tachyon potential increases, the effect of interaction between branes on the 4D universe expansion becomes systematically more effective, because at higher energies there exists more channels for flowing energy from extra dimension to other four dimensions. Finally, we test our model against WMAP and Planck data and obtain the ripping time. According to experimental data, $N\\simeq 50$ case leads to $n_{s}\\simeq 0.96$, where \\emph{N} and $n_{s}$ are the number e-folds and the spectral index respectively. This standard case may be found in $0.01 < R_{Tensor-scalar } < 0.22$, where $R_{Tensor-scalar }$ is the tensor-scalar ratio.

Using this model, we investigate the different eras of the expanding universe and stability with the help of the equation of state (EoS) parameter $\\omega_{eff}$ and squared speed of sound $v_s^2$, respectively. It is mentioned here that the reconstructed model represents the quintessence era of the accelerated expansion of the universe with instability. Moreover, the statefinder trajectories are studied and we find out that the model is not capable of reaching the $\\Lambda$CDM phase of the universe. ",

    "abstract": "  A relativistic theory of surficial Love numbers, which characterize the surface deformation of a body subjected to tidal forces, was initiated by Damour and Nagar. We revisit this effort in order to extend it, clarify some of its aspects, and simplify its computational implementation. First, we refine the definition of surficial Love numbers proposed by Damour and Nagar, and formulate it directly in terms of the deformed curvature of the body's surface, a meaningful geometrical quantity. Second, we develop a unified theory of surficial Love numbers that applies equally well to material bodies and black holes. Third, we derive a compactness-dependent relation between the surficial and (electric-type) gravitational Love numbers of a perfect-fluid body, and show that it reduces to the familiar Newtonian relation when the compactness is small. And fourth, we simplify the tasks associated with the practical computation of the surficial and gravitational Love numbers for a material body. ",

    "abstract": "  We investigate the late-time cosmological behaviour of scalar-tensor theories with a universal multiplicative coupling between the scalar field and the matter Lagrangian in the matter era. This class of theory encompasses the case of the massless string dilaton (see Damour and Polyakov, General Relativity and Gravitation, 26, 1171) as well as a theory with an intrinsic decoupling mechanism in the solar system (see Minazzoli and Hees, Phys. Rev. D 88, 041504). The cosmological evolution is studied in the General Relativity limit justified by solar system constraints on the gravitation theory. The behaviour of these cosmological evolutions are then compared to two types of observations: the constraints on temporal variations of the constants of Nature and the distance-luminosity measurements. In particular, the non-minimal coupling implies that the distance-luminosity relation is modified compared to General Relativity. Theories producing a cosmological behaviour in agreement with these observations are identified. ",

    "abstract": "  We report results from a search for gravitational waves produced by perturbed intermediate mass black holes (IMBH) in data collected by LIGO and Virgo between 2005 and 2010. The search was sensitive to astrophysical sources that produced damped sinusoid gravitational wave signals, also known as ringdowns, with frequency $50\\le f_{0}/\\mathrm{Hz} \\le 2000$ and decay timescale $0.0001\\lesssim \\tau/\\mathrm{s} \\lesssim 0.1$ characteristic of those produced in mergers of IMBH pairs. No significant gravitational wave candidate was detected. We report upper limits on the astrophysical coalescence rates of IMBHs with total binary mass $50 \\le M/\\mathrm{M}_\\odot \\le 450$ and component mass ratios of either 1:1 or 4:1. For systems with total mass $100 \\le M/\\mathrm{M}_\\odot \\le 150$, we report a 90%-confidence upper limit on the rate of binary IMBH mergers with non-spinning and equal mass components of $6.9\\times10^{-8}\\,$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. We also report a rate upper limit for ringdown waveforms from perturbed IMBHs, radiating 1% of their mass as gravitational waves in the fundamental, $\\ell=m=2$, oscillation mode, that is nearly three orders of magnitude more stringent than previous results.

The energy density at the centre of the star characterizes the solutions, and for each choice of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\\alpha$ we obtain a one parameter family of solutions. All solutions respect the first law of thermodynamics; in the numerical case to within 1 part in $10^6$. We describe the dependence of the angular velocity, mass, and angular momentum of the boson stars on $\\alpha$ and on the dimensionality. For D>5, these quantities exhibit damped oscillations about finite central values as the central energy density tends to infinity, where the amplitude of oscillation increases nonlinearly with $\\alpha$. In the limit of diverging central energy density, the Kretschmann invariant at the centre of the boson star also diverges. This is in contrast to the D=5 case, where the Kretschmann invariant diverges at a finite value of the central energy density. ",

    "abstract": "  Quantum field theory in the $4$-dimensional de Sitter space-time is constructed on a unique Bunch-Davies vacuum state in the ambient space formalism in a rigorous mathematical framework. This work is based on the group representation theory and the analyticity of the complexified pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. The unitary irreducible representations of de Sitter group and their corresponding Hilbert spaces are reformulated in the ambient space formalism. Defining the creation and annihilation operators, quantum field operators and their corresponding analytic two-point functions for various spin fields ($s=0,\\frac{1}{2},1,\\frac{3}{2}, 2$) have been constructed. The various spin massless fields can be constructed in terms of the massless conformally coupled scalar field in this formalism. Then the quantum massless minimally coupled scalar field operator, for the first time, is also constructed on Bunch-Davies vacuum state which preserve the analyticity. We show that the massless fields with $s\\leq 2$ can only propagate in de Sitter ambient space formalism. The massless gauge invariant field equations with $s=1, \\frac{3}{2}, 2$ are studied by using the gauge principle. The conformal quantum spin-$2$ field, based on the gauge gravity model, is studied. The gauge spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ fields satisfy the Grassmannian algebra, and hence, naturally provoke one to couple them with the gauge spin-$2$ field and the super-algebra is automatically appeared. We conclude that the gravitational field may be constructed by three parts, namely, the de Sitter background, the gauge spin-$2$ field and the gauge spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ field. ",

We apply the techniques developed in full Loop Quantum Gravity to define the semiclassical states in the kinematical Hilbert space and evaluating the expectation value of the euclidean scalar constraint we demonstrate that it coincides with the classical expression, {\\it i.e.} the one of a local Bianchi I dynamics. The result holds as a leading order expansion in the scale factors of the Universe and opens the way to study the subleading corrections to the semiclassical dynamics. We outline how by retaining a suitable finite coordinate length for holonomies our effective Hamiltonian at the leading order coincides with the one expected from LQC.

It is a deformation of the flat phase space $\\mathrm{ISO}(3)$ and reproduces the latter in a suitable limit. The $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ phase space is then used to build a new, deformed LQG phase space associated to graphs. It can be equipped with a set of Gauss constraints and flatness constraints, which form a first class system and Poisson-generate local 3D rotations and deformed translations. We provide a geometrical interpretation for this lattice phase space with constraints in terms of consistently glued hyperbolic triangles, i.e. hyperbolic discrete geometries, thus validating our construction as accounting for a constant curvature $\\Lambda<0$. Finally, using ribbon diagrams, we show that our new model is topological. ",

    "abstract": "  We consider the retarded solution to the scalar, electromagnetic, and linearized gravitational field equations in Minkowski spacetime, with source given by a particle moving on a null geodesic. In the scalar case and in the Lorenz gauge in the electromagnetic and gravitational cases, the retarded integral over the infinite past of the source does not converge as a distribution, so we cut off the null source suitably at a finite time $t_0$ and then consider two different limits: (i) the limit as the observation point goes to null infinity at fixed $t_0$, from which the ``$1/r$'' part of the fields can be extracted and (ii) the limit $t_0 \\to - \\infty$ at fixed ``observation point.'' The limit (i) gives rise to a ``velocity kick'' on distant test particles in the scalar and electromagnetic cases, and it gives rise to a ``memory effect'' (i.e., a permanent change in relative separation of two test particles) in the linearized gravitational case, in agreement with previous analyses. Although the second limit does not exist for the Lorenz gauge potentials in the electromagnetic and linearized gravitational cases, we obtain a well defined distributional limit for the electromagnetic field strength and for the linearized Riemann tensor. In the gravitational case, this limit agrees with the Aichelberg-Sexl solution, but there is no ``memory effect'' associated with this limiting solution.

Due to the symmetry of the isolated horizon, it turns out that the boundary degrees of freedom can be described by a SO(1,1) BF theory with sources. This provides a new alternative approach to the usual one using Chern-Simons theory to study the black hole entropy. To count the microscopical degrees of freedom with the boundary BF theory, the entropy of the isolated horizon can also be calculated in the framework of loop quantum gravity. The leading-order contribution to the entropy coincides with the Bekenstein-Hawking area law only for a particular choice of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, which is different from its value in the usual approach using Chern-Simons theory. Moreover, the quantum correction to the entropy formula is a constant term rather than a logarithmic term. ",

These systems are described by a combination of the Gross-Pitaevskii and Poisson equations (the GPP system). In the analysis of these hypothetical objects, the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation is widely used. This approximation is based on the assumption that in the presence of a large number of particles, the kinetic term in the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional can be neglected, yet this assumption is violated near the condensate surface. We also show that the total energy of the self-gravitating condensate in the TF-approximation is positive. The stability of a self-gravitating system is dependent on the total energy being negative. Therefore, the TF approximation is ill suited to formulate initial conditions in numerical simulations. As an alternative, we offer an approximate solution of the full GPP system. ",

In the freeze frame the universe emerges from an almost static state with flat geometry. After entropy production it shrinks and \"thaws\" slowly from a \"freeze state\" with extremely low temperature. The field transformation to the second \"big bang picture\" (Einstein frame) is singular. This \"field singularity\" is responsible for an apparent singularity of the big bang. Furthermore, we argue that past-incomplete geodesics do not necessarily indicate a singularity or beginning of the universe. Proper time ceases to be a useful concept for physical time if particles become massless. We propose to define physical time by counting the number of zeros of a component of the wave function.

In this paper, we present such a proof based on the analytic solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation (WDWE). Explicit solutions of the WDWE for the special operator ordering factor p=-2 (or 4) show that, once a small true vacuum bubble is created by quantum fluctuations of the metastable false vacuum, it can expand exponentially no matter whether the bubble is closed, flat or open. The exponential expansion will end when the bubble becomes large and thus the early universe appears. With the de Broglie-Bohm quantum trajectory theory, we show explicitly that it is the quantum potential that plays the role of the cosmological constant and provides the power for the exponential expansion of the true vacuum bubble. So it is clear that the birth of the early universe completely depends on the quantum nature of the theory. ",

In the mirror spacetime the transition rate traces the onset of an energy flux from the mirror, with the expected Planckian late time asymptotics.

    "abstract": "  It was first pointed out by Press and Teukolsky that a system composed of a spinning Kerr black hole surrounded by a reflecting mirror may develop instabilities. The physical mechanism responsible for the development of these exponentially growing instabilities is the superradiant amplification of bosonic fields confined between the black hole and the mirror. A remarkable feature of this composed black-hole-mirror-field system is the existence of a critical mirror radius, $r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$, which supports {\\it stationary} (marginally-stable) field configurations. This critical (`stationary') mirror radius marks the boundary between stable and unstable black-hole-mirror-field configurations: composed systems whose confining mirror is situated in the region $r_{\\text{m}}<r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$ are stable (that is, all modes of the confined field decay in time), whereas composed systems whose confining mirror is situated in the region $r_{\\text{m}}>r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$ are unstable (that is, there are confined field modes which grow exponentially over time). In the present paper we explore this critical (marginally-stable) boundary between stable and explosive black-hole-mirror-field configurations. It is shown that the innermost ({\\it smallest}) radius of the confining mirror which allows the extraction of rotational energy from a spinning Kerr black hole approaches the black-hole horizon radius in the extremal limit of rapidly-rotating black holes. We find, in particular, that this critical mirror radius (which marks the onset of superradiant instabilities in the composed system) scales linearly with the black-hole temperature. ",

These bounds, obtained within truncated Renormalization Group flows, indicate the compatibility of asymptotic safety with the matter fields of the standard model.

In few tens of seconds the gradients smooth out while the star contracts and cools down, until it becomes a neutron star. In this paper we study this phase of the proto-neutron star life including rotation, and employing finite temperature equations of state. We model the evolution of the rotation rate, and determine the relevant quantities characterizing the star. Our results show that an isolated neutron star cannot reach, at the end of the evolution, the maximum values of mass and rotation rate allowed by the zero-temperature equation of state. Moreover, a mature neutron star evolved in isolation cannot rotate too rapidly, even if it is born from a proto-neutron star rotating at the mass-shedding limit.

In this framework, the activation of a new flaring region in the hot corona imprints a time variation on the iron line spectrum. Future X-ray facilities with high time resolution and large effective areas may be able to measure the so-called 2-dimensional transfer function; that is, the iron line profile detected by a distant observer as a function of time in response to an instantaneous flare from the X-ray primary source. This work is a preliminary study to determine if and how such a technique can provide more information about the spacetime geometry around the compact object than the already possible measurements of the time-integrated iron line profile. Within our simplified model, we find that a measurement of iron line reverberation can improve constraints appreciably given a sufficiently strong signal, though that most of the information is present in the time-integrated spectrum. Our aim is to test the Kerr metric. We find that current X-ray facilities and data are unable to provide strong tests of the Kerr nature of supermassive black hole candidates. We consider an optimistic case of $10^5$ iron line photons from a next-generation data set. With such data, the reverberation model improves upon the spectral constraint by an order of magnitude. ",

    "abstract": "  Ultracompact objects are self-gravitating systems with a light ring. It was recently suggested that fluctuations in the background of these objects are extremely long-lived and might turn unstable at the nonlinear level, if the object is not endowed with a horizon. If correct, this result has important consequences: objects with a light ring are black holes. In other words, the nonlinear instability of ultracompact stars would provide a strong argument in favor of the \"black hole hypothesis,\" once electromagnetic or gravitational-wave observations confirm the existence of light rings. Here we explore in some depth the mode structure of ultracompact stars, in particular constant-density stars and gravastars. We show that the existence of very long-lived modes -- localized near a second, stable null geodesic -- is a generic feature of gravitational perturbations of such configurations. Already at the linear level, such modes become unstable if the object rotates sufficiently fast to develop an ergoregion. Finally, we conjecture that the long-lived modes become unstable under fragmentation via a Dyson-Chandrasekhar-Fermi mechanism at the nonlinear level. Depending on the structure of the star, it is also possible that nonlinearities lead to the formation of small black holes close to the stable light ring. Our results suggest that the mere observation of a light ring is a strong evidence for the existence of black holes. ",

    "abstract": "  We study the quantum dynamics of a supersymmetric squashed three-sphere by dimensionally reducing to one timelike dimension the action of D=4 simple supergravity for a Bianchi IX cosmological model. After imposition of the diffeomorphism constraints, the wave function of the Universe becomes a spinor of Spin(8,4) depending on the three squashing parameters, which satisfies Dirac, and Klein-Gordon-like, wave equations describing the propagation of a quantum spinning particle reflecting off spin-dependent potential walls. The algebra of the susy constraints and of the Hamiltonian one is found to close. One finds that the quantum Hamiltonian is built from operators that generate a 64-dimensional representation of the maximally compact sub-algebra of the rank-3 hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra AE3. The (quartic-in-fermions) squared-mass term entering the Klein-Gordon-like equation has several remarkable properties: 1)it commutes with all the other (Kac-Moody-related) building blocks of the Hamiltonian; 2)it is a quadratic function of the fermion number NF; 3)it is negative in most of the Hilbert space. The latter property leads to a possible quantum avoidance of the singularity (\"cosmological bounce\"), and suggests imposing the boundary condition that the wavefunction of the Universe vanish when the volume of space tends to zero. The space of solutions is a mixture of \"discrete-spectrum states\" (explicitely given) and of continuous-spectrum states (parametrized by arbitrary functions entering some initial-value problem). The predominantly negative values of the squared-mass term lead to a \"bottle effect\" between small and large volume-Universes and to a possible reduction of the continuous spectrum to a discrete spectrum of quantum states looking like excited versions of the Planckian-size Universes described by the discrete states at fermionic levels NF=0 and 1.

Therefore, the local noncommutativity cannot be treated as the origin of the natural cutoffs. We find that symplectic manifolds with compact topology are naturally cutoff-regularized, independent of the chart in which the physical system is considered. By taking this fact and universality of quantum gravity effects into account, we conclude that the cutoffs should be global (topological) properties of the symplectic manifold.

In a previous work, we derived experimental constraints on the Galileon model with no explicit coupling to matter and showed that this model agrees with the most recent cosmological data. In the context of braneworld constructions or massive gravity, the Galileon model exhibits a disformal coupling to matter, which we study in this paper. After comparing our constraints on the uncoupled model with recent studies, we extend the analysis framework to the disformally coupled Galileon model and derive the first experimental constraints on that coupling, using precise measurements of cosmological distances and the growth rate of cosmic structures. In the uncoupled case, with updated data, we still observe a low tension between the constraints set by growth data and those from distances. In the disformally coupled Galileon model, we obtain better agreement with data and favour a non-zero disformal coupling to matter at the $2.5\\sigma$ level.

Further, they explicitly exhibit the duality which exists between a nearly matter dominated Universe in its contracting phase and the quasi de Sitter regime in the expanding one. The results obtained also confirm and extend the known evidence that the spectral index for a matter dominated Universe in the contracting phase is, in fact, the same as the spectral index for an exact Sitter regime in the expanding phase. Finally, in both the inflationary and the matter bounce scenarios, the theoretical values of the spectral index and of the running parameter are compared with their experimental counterparts, obtained from the most recent PLANCK data, with the result that the bouncing models here discussed do fit well accurate astronomical observations.

    "abstract": "  Gravitational-wave observations of inspiralling binary neutron star systems can be used to measure the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) through the tidally induced shift in the waveform phase that depends on the tidal deformability parameter $\\lambda$. Previous work has shown that $\\lambda$, a function of the neutron-star EOS and mass, is measurable by Advanced LIGO for a single event when including tidal information up to the merger frequency. In this work, we describe a method for stacking measurements of $\\lambda$ from multiple inspiral events to measure the EOS. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the parameters of a 4-parameter piecewise polytrope EOS that matches theoretical EOS models to a few percent. We find that, for \"realistic\" event rates ($\\sim 40$ binary neutron star inspiral events per year with signal-to-noise ratio $> 8$ in a single Advanced LIGO detector), combining a year of gravitational-wave data from a three-detector network with the constraints from causality and recent high mass neutron-star measurements, the EOS above nuclear density can be measured to better than a factor of two in pressure in most cases. We also find that in the mass range $1M_\\odot$--$2M_\\odot$, the neutron-star radius can be measured to better than $\\pm 1$ km and the tidal deformability can be measured to better than $\\pm 1 \\times 10^{36}$ g cm$^2$ s$^2$ (10%--50% depending on the EOS and mass). The overwhelming majority of this information comes from the loudest $\\sim 5$ events. Current uncertainties in the post-Newtonian waveform model, however, lead to systematic errors in the EOS measurement that are as large as the statistical errors, and more accurate waveform models are needed to minimize this error.

These amount to different choices of relations between local variables and the smeared ones entering the definition of the coherent states.

    "abstract": "  Certain scalar-tensor theories have the property of endowing stars with scalar hair, sourced either by the star's own compactness (spontaneous scalarization) or, for binary systems, by the companion's scalar hair (induced scalarization) or by the orbital binding energy (dynamical scalarization). Scalarized stars in binaries present different conservative dynamics than in General Relativity, and can also excite a scalar mode in the metric perturbation that carries away dipolar radiation. As a result, the binary orbit shrinks faster than predicted in General Relativity, modifying the rate of decay of the orbital period. In spite of this, scalar-tensor theories can pass existing binary pulsar tests, because observed pulsars may not be compact enough or sufficiently orbitally bound to activate scalarization. Gravitational waves emitted during the last stages of compact binary inspirals are thus ideal probes of scalarization effects. For the standard projected sensitivity of advanced LIGO, we here show that, if neutron stars are sufficiently compact to enter the detector's sensitivity band already scalarized, then gravitational waves could place constraints at least comparable to binary pulsars. If the stars dynamically scalarize while inspiraling in band, then constraints are still possible provided the scalarization occurs sufficiently early in the inspiral, roughly below an orbital frequency of 50Hz. In performing these studies, we derive an easy-to-calculate data analysis measure, an integrated phase difference between a General Relativistic and a modified signal, that maps directly to the Bayes factor so as to determine whether a modified gravity effect is detectable. Finally, we find that custom-made templates are equally effective as model-independent, parameterized post-Einsteinian waveforms at detecting such modified gravity effects at realistic signal-to-noise ratios.

    "abstract": "  Using effective dynamics, we investigate the behavior of expansion and shear scalars in different proposed quantizations of the Kantowski-Sachs spacetime with matter in loop quantum cosmology. We find that out of the various proposed choices, there is only one known prescription which leads to the generic bounded behavior of these scalars. The bounds turn out to be universal and are determined by the underlying quantum geometry. This quantization is analogous to the so called 'improved dynamics' in the isotropic loop quantum cosmology, which is also the only one to respect the freedom of the rescaling of the fiducial cell at the level of effective spacetime description. Other proposed quantization prescriptions yield expansion and shear scalars which may not be bounded for certain initial conditions within the validity of effective spacetime description. These prescriptions also have a limitation that the \"quantum geometric effects\" can occur at an arbitrary scale. We show that the `improved dynamics' of Kantowski-Sachs spacetime turns out to be a unique choice in a general class of possible quantization prescriptions, in the sense of leading to generic bounds on expansion and shear scalars and the associated physics being free from fiducial cell dependence. The behavior of the energy density in the `improved dynamics' reveals some interesting features. Even without considering any details of the dynamical evolution, it is possible to rule out pancake singularities in this spacetime. The energy density is found to be dynamically bounded. These results show that the Planck scale physics of the loop quantized Kantowski-Sachs spacetime has key features common with the loop quantization of isotropic and Bianchi-I spacetimes. ",

    "abstract": "  We describe an alternative approach to the analysis of gravitational-wave backgrounds, based on the formalism used to characterise the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background. In contrast to standard analyses, this approach makes no assumptions about the nature of the background and so has the potential to reveal much more about the physical processes that generated it. An arbitrary background can be decomposed into modes whose angular dependence on the sky is given by gradients and curls of spherical harmonics. We derive the pulsar timing overlap reduction functions for the individual modes, which are given by simple combinations of spherical harmonics evaluated at the pulsar locations. We show how these can be used to recover the components of an arbitrary background, giving explicit results for both isotropic and anisotropic uncorrelated backgrounds. We also find that the response of a pulsar timing array to curl modes is identically zero, so half of the gravitational-wave sky will never be observed using pulsar timing, no matter how many pulsars are included in the array. An isotropic, unpolarised and uncorrelated background can be accurately represented using only three modes, and so a search of this type will be only slightly more complicated than the standard cross-correlation search using the Hellings and Downs overlap reduction function. However, by measuring the components of individual modes of the background and checking for consistency with isotropy, this approach has the potential to reveal much more information. Each individual mode on its own describes a background that is correlated between different points on the sky. A measurement of the components that indicates the presence of correlations in the background on large angular scales would suggest startling new physics. ",

    "abstract": "  A new model is proposed to a collapsing star consisting of an initial inhomogeneous energy density and anisotropic pressure fluid with shear, radial heat flow and outgoing radiation. In previous papers one of us has always assumed an initial star with homogeneous energy density. The aim of this work is to generalize the previous models by introducing an initial inhomogeneous energy density and compare it to the initial homogeneous energy density collapse model. We will show the differences between these models in the evolution of all physical quantities that characterizes the gravitational collapse. The behavior of the energy density, pressure, mass, luminosity and the effective adiabatic index is analyzed. The pressure of the star, at the beginning of the collapse, is isotropic but due to the presence of the shear the pressure becomes more and more anisotropic. The black hole is never formed because the apparent horizon formation condition is never satisfied, in contrast of the previous model where a black hole is formed. An observer at infinity sees a radial point source radiating exponentially until reaches the time of maximum luminosity and suddenly the star turns off. In contrast of the former model where the luminosity also increases exponentially, reaching a maximum and after it decreases until the formation of the black hole. The effective adiabatic index is always positive without any discontinuity in contrast of the former model where there is a discontinuity around the time of maximum luminosity. The collapse is about three thousand times slower than in the case where the energy density is initially homogeneous. ",

    "abstract": "  The post-Newtonian approximation is still the most widely used approach to obtaining explicit solutions in general relativity, especially for the relativistic two-body problem with arbitrary mass ratio. Within many of its applications, it is often required to use a regularization procedure. Though frequently misunderstood, the regularization is essential for waveform generation without reference to the internal structure of orbiting bodies. In recent years, direct comparison with the self-force approach, constructed specifically for highly relativistic particles in the extreme mass ratio limit, has enabled preliminary confirmation of the foundations of both computational methods, including their very independent regularization procedures, with high numerical precision. In this paper, we build upon earlier work to carry this comparison still further, by examining next-to-next-to-leading order contributions beyond the half integral 5.5PN conservative effect, which arise from terms to cubic and higher orders in the metric and its multipole moments, thus extending scrutiny of the post-Newtonian methods to one of the highest orders yet achieved. We do this by explicitly constructing tail-of-tail terms at 6.5PN and 7.5PN order, computing the redshift factor for compact binaries in the small mass ratio limit, and comparing directly with numerically and analytically computed terms in the self-force approach, obtained using solutions for metric perturbations in the Schwarzschild space-time, and a combination of exact series representations possibly with more typical PN expansions. While self-force results may be relativistic but with restricted mass ratio, our methods, valid primarily in the weak-field slowly-moving regime, are nevertheless in principle applicable for arbitrary mass ratios.

However, current parameter estimation approaches for such scenarios can lead to computationally intractable problems in practice. Therefore there is a pressing need for new, fast and accurate Bayesian inference techniques. In this letter we demonstrate that a reduced order modeling approach enables rapid parameter estimation studies. By implementing a reduced order quadrature scheme within the LIGO Algorithm Library, we show that Bayesian inference on the 9-dimensional parameter space of non-spinning binary neutron star inspirals can be sped up by a factor of 30 for the early advanced detectors' configurations. This speed-up will increase to about $150$ as the detectors improve their low-frequency limit to 10Hz, reducing to hours analyses which would otherwise take months to complete. Although these results focus on gravitational detectors, the techniques are broadly applicable to any experiment where fast Bayesian analysis is desirable. ",

Motivated from thermodynamical point of view, cosmological solutions are evaluated for the particle creation rates in three cosmic phases, namely, inflation, matter dominated and present late time acceleration. The deceleration parameter ($q$) is expressed as a function of the redshift parameter ($z$), and its variation is presented graphically. Also, statefinder analysis has been presented graphically in three different phases of the universe. Finally, two non-interacting fluids with different particle creation rates are considered as cosmic substratum, and deceleration parameter ($q$) is evaluated.

In particular, we discuss two opposite limiting cases. In the first case, the width of the centre-of-mass wave packet is assumed much larger than the actual extent of the object, in the second case it is assumed much smaller. Both cases result in non-linear deviations from ordinary free Schroedinger evolution for the centre of mass. On a general conceptual level we include some discussion in order to clarify the physical basis and intention for studying the Schroedinger-Newton equation. ",

The kinetic corrections due to space-time curvature are shown to lift the familiar (n,j) degeneracy of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. We supplement the discussion by a consideration of an attractive scalar potential, which, in the fully relativistic Dirac formalism, modifies the mass of the particle according to the replacement m -> m (1 - \\lambda/r), where r is the radial coordinate. We conclude with a few comments regarding the (n,j) degeneracy of the energy levels, where n is the principal quantum number, and j is the total angular momentum, and illustrate the calculations by way of a numerical example.

    "abstract": "  Magnetic fields surrounding spinning black holes can confine radiation and trigger superradiant instabilities. To investigate this effect, we perform the first fully-consistent linear analysis of the Ernst spacetime, an exact solution of the Einstein--Maxwell equations describing a black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$. In the limit in which the black-hole mass vanishes, the background reduces to the marginally stable Melvin spacetime. The presence of an event horizon introduces a small dissipative term, resulting in a set of long-lived -- or unstable -- modes. We provide a simple interpretation of the mode spectrum in terms of a small perfect absorber immersed in a confining box of size $\\sim1/B$ and show that rotation triggers a superradiant instability. By studying scalar perturbations of a magnetized Kerr--Newman black hole, we are able to confirm and quantify the details of this instability. The instability time scale can be orders of magnitude shorter than that associated to massive bosonic fields. The instability extracts angular momentum from the event horizon, competing against accretion. This implies that strong magnetic fields set an upper bound on the black-hole spin. Conversely, observations of highly-spinning massive black holes impose an intrinsic limit to the strength of the surrounding magnetic field. We discuss the astrophysical implications of our results and the limitations of the Ernst spacetime to describe realistic astrophysical configurations. ",

This requires a considerable deviation from the strategy followed by Dafermos, focusing on the level sets of the radius function instead of the red-shift and blue-shift regions. We also present new results on the global structure of the solution when the free data is not identically zero in a neighborhood of the origin.

The former allow a uniquely determined dynamical evolution of the system, and the latter guarantee that causality is preserved and that \"plausible\" physical sources have been considered. In this work, we consider the further degrees of freedom related to curvature invariants and scalar fields in Extended Theories of Gravity (ETG). These new degrees of freedom can be recast as effective perfect fluids that carry different meanings with respect to the standard matter fluids generally adopted as sources of the field equations. It is thus somewhat misleading to apply the standard general relativistic energy conditions to this effective energy-momentum, as the latter contains the matter content and a geometrical quantity, which arises from the ETG considered. Here, we explore this subtlety, extending on previous work, in particular, to cases with the contracted Bianchi identities with diffeomorphism invariance and to cases with generalized explicit curvature-matter couplings, which imply the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. Furthermore, we apply the analysis to specific ETGs, such as scalar-tensor gravity, $f(R)$ gravity and modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Interesting results appear such as matter that may exhibit unusual thermodynamical features, for instance, and gravity that retains its attractive character in the presence of negative pressures; or alternatively, we verify that repulsive gravity may occur for standard matter.

    "abstract": "  Massive fields can exist in long-lived configurations around black holes. We examine how the gravitational wave signal of a perturbed black hole is affected by such `dirtiness' within linear theory. As a concrete example, we consider the gravitational radiation emitted by the infall of a massive scalar field into a Schwarzschild black hole. Whereas part of the scalar field is absorbed/scattered by the black hole and triggers gravitational wave emission, another part lingers in long-lived quasi-bound states. Solving numerically the Teukolsky master equation for gravitational perturbations coupled to the massive Klein-Gordon equation, we find a characteristic gravitational wave signal, composed by a quasi-normal ringing followed by a late time tail. In contrast to `clean' black holes, however, the late time tail contains small amplitude wiggles with the frequency of the dominating quasi-bound state. Additionally, an observer dependent beating pattern may also be seen. These features were already observed in fully non-linear studies; our analysis shows they are present at linear level, and, since it reduces to a 1+1 dimensional numerical problem, allows for cleaner numerical data. Moreover, we discuss the power law of the tail and that it only becomes universal sufficiently far away from the `dirty' black hole. The wiggly tails, by constrast, are a generic feature that may be used as a smoking gun for the presence of massive fields around black holes, either as a linear cloud or as fully non-linear hair. ",

    "abstract": "  There are a number of theoretical predictions for astrophysical and cosmological objects, which emit high frequency ($10^6-10^9$~Hz) Gravitation Waves (GW) or contribute somehow to the stochastic high frequency GW background. Here we propose a new sensitive detector in this frequency band, which is based on existing cryogenic ultra-high quality factor quartz Bulk Acoustic Wave cavity technology, coupled to near-quantum-limited SQUID amplifiers at $20$~mK. We show that spectral strain sensitivities reaching $10^{-22}$ per $\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ per mode is possible, which in principle can cover the frequency range with multiple ($>100$) modes with quality factors varying between $10^6-10^{10}$ allowing wide bandwidth detection. Due to its compactness and well established manufacturing process, the system is easily scalable into arrays and distributed networks that can also impact the overall sensitivity and introduce coincidence analysis to ensure no false detections.

    "abstract": "  In this paper we discuss a possible cosmological time evolution of fundamental constants from the theoretical and experimental point of views. On the theoretical side, we explain that such a cosmological time evolution is actually something very natural which can be described by mechanisms similar to those used to explain cosmic inflation. We then discuss implications for grand unified theories, showing that the unification condition of the gauge coupling could evolve with cosmological time. Measurements of the electron-to-proton mass ratio can test grand unified theories using low energy data. Following the theoretical discussion, we review the current status of precision measurements of fundamental constants and their potential cosmological time dependence. ",

    "abstract": "  According to general relativity, trapping surfaces and horizons are classical causal structures that arise in systems with sharply defined energy and corresponding gravitational radius. The latter concept can be extended to a quantum mechanical state simply by means of the spectral decomposition, which allows one to define an associated \"horizon wave-function\". Since this auxiliary wave-function contains crucial information about the causal structure of space-time, a new proposal is formulated for the time-evolution of quantum states in order to account for the fundamental classical property that outer observers cannot receive signals from inside a horizon. The simple case of a single massive free particle at rest is used throughout the paper as a toy model to illustrate the main ideas. ",

    "abstract": "  We recently introduced a new representation for loop quantum gravity, which is based on the BF vacuum and is in this sense much nearer to the spirit of spin foam dynamics. In the present paper we lay out the classical framework underlying this new formulation. The central objects in our construction are the so-called integrated fluxes, which are defined as the integral of the electric field variable over surfaces of codimension one, and related in turn to Wilson surface operators. These integrated flux observables will play an important role in the coarse graining of states in loop quantum gravity, and can be used to encode in this context the notion of curvature-induced torsion. We furthermore define a continuum phase space as the modified projective limit of a family of discrete phase spaces based on triangulations. This continuum phase space yields a continuum (holonomy-flux) algebra of observables. We show that the corresponding Poisson algebra is closed by computing the Poisson brackets between the integrated fluxes, which have the novel property of being allowed to intersect each other. ",

    "abstract": "  As is known, in modified cosmological theories of gravity many of the cosmologies which could not be generated by standard Einstein gravity, can be consistently described by $F(R)$ theories. Using known reconstruction techniques, we investigate which $F(R)$ theories can lead to a Hubble parameter describing two types of cosmological bounces, the superbounce model, related to supergravity and non-supersymmetric models of contracting ekpyrosis and also the Loop Quantum Cosmology modified ekpyrotic model. Since our method is an approximate method, we investigate the problem at large and small curvatures. As we evince, both models yield power law reconstructed $F(R)$ gravities, with the most interesting new feature being that both lead to accelerating cosmologies, in the large curvature approximation. The mathematical properties of the some Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes $M$, that describe superbounce-like cosmologies are also pointed out, with regards to the group of curvature collineations $CC(M)$.

    "abstract": "  We consider the dynamics of a spherically symmetric massless scalar field coupled to general relativity in Anti--de Sitter spacetime in the small-amplitude limit. Within the context of our previously developed two time framework (TTF) to study the leading self-gravitating effects, we demonstrate the existence of two new conserved quantities in addition to the known total energy $E$ of the modes: The particle number $N$ and Hamiltonian $H$ of our TTF system. Simultaneous conservation of $E$ and $N$ implies that weak turbulent processes undergo dual cascades (direct cascade of $E$ and inverse cascade of $N$ or vice versa). This partially explains the observed dynamics of 2-mode initial data. In addition, conservation of $E$ and $N$ limits the region of phase space that can be explored within the TTF approximation and in particular rules out equipartion of energy among the modes for general initial data. Finally, we discuss possible effects of conservation of $N$ and $E$ on late time dynamics. ",

The strength of the gravitational constant is $G=G_N(1+\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha$ is a parameter. A regular singularity-free MOG solution is derived using a nonlinear field dynamics for the repulsive gravitational field component and a reasonable physical energy-momentum tensor. The Kruskal-Szekeres completion of the MOG black hole solution is obtained. The Kerr-MOG black hole solution is determined by the mass $M$, the parameter $\\alpha$ and the spin angular momentum $J=Ma$. The equations of motion and the stability condition of a test particle orbiting the MOG black hole are derived, and the radius of the black hole photosphere and the shadows cast by the Schwarzschild-MOG and Kerr-MOG black holes are calculated. A traversable wormhole solution is constructed with a throat stabilized by the repulsive component of the gravitational field. ",

    "abstract": "  The leading order finite size effects due to spin, namely that of the cubic and quartic spin interaction, are derived for the first time for generic compact binaries via an Effective Field Theory approach. These corrections enter at the third and a half and fourth post-Newtonian orders, respectively, for rapidly rotating compact objects. Hence, we complete the leading order finite size effects with spin up to the fourth post-Newtonian accuracy. We arrive at this by augmenting the effective action with new higher dimensional nonminimal coupling worldline operators, involving higher-order derivatives of the field, and introducing new Wilson coefficients, corresponding to constants, which describe the octupole and hexadecapole deformations of the object due to spin. These Wilson coefficients are matched to unity in the black hole case. The nonminimal coupling worldline operators enter the action with the electric and magnetic, even and odd parity type, components of the Weyl tensor coupled to the even and odd worldline spins, respectively. Moreover, the non relativistic gravitational field decomposition, which we employ, demonstrates a coupling hierarchy of the gravito-magnetic vector and the Newtonian scalar, to the odd and even in spin operators, respectively, which extends that of the minimal coupling case. This observation is useful for the construction of the Feynman diagrams, and provides an instructive analogy between the leading order spin-orbit and cubic spin interactions, and between the leading order quadratic spin and quartic spin interactions.

    "abstract": "  We propose a general framework for the study of asymptotically flat black objects with $k+1$ equal magnitude angular momenta in $d\\geq 5$ spacetime dimensions (with $0\\leq k\\leq \\big[\\frac{d-5}{2} \\big]$). In this approach, the dependence on all angular coordinates but one is factorized, which leads to a codimension-two problem. This framework can describe black holes with spherical horizon topology, the simplest solutions corresponding to a class of Myers-Perry black holes. A different set of solutions describes balanced black objects with $S^{n+1} \\times S^{2k+1}$ horizon topology. The simplest members of this family are the black rings $(k=0)$. The solutions with $k>0$ are dubbed $black~ringoids$. Based on the nonperturbative numerical results found for several values of $(n,k)$, we propose a general picture for the properties and the phase diagram of these solutions and the associated black holes with spherical horizon topology: $n=1$ black ringoids repeat the $k=0$ pattern of black rings and Myers-Perry black holes in 5 dimensions, whereas $n>1$ black ringoids follow the pattern of higher dimensional black rings associated with `pinched' black holes and Myers-Perry black holes.

    "abstract": "  The fraction of primordial black holes (PBHs) of masses $10^{17} - 10^{26}$ g in the total amount of dark matter may be constrained by considering their capture by neutron stars (NSs), which leads to the rapid destruction of the latter. The constraints depend crucially on the capture rate which, in turn, is determined by the energy loss by a PBH passing through a NS. Two alternative approaches to estimate the energy loss have been used in the literature: the one based on the dynamical friction mechanism, and another on tidal deformations of the NS by the PBH. The second mechanism was claimed to be more efficient by several orders of magnitude due to the excitation of particular oscillation modes reminiscent of the surface waves. We address this disagreement by considering a simple analytically solvable model that consists of a flat incompressible fluid in an external gravitational field. In this model, we calculate the energy loss by a PBH traversing the fluid surface. We find that the excitation of modes with the propagation velocity smaller than that of PBH is suppressed, which implies that in a realistic situation of a supersonic PBH the large contributions from the surface waves are absent and the above two approaches lead to consistent expressions for the energy loss.

This paper focuses on calculating the ballistic rate of return of debris to the black hole as this rate is commonly assumed to be proportional to the light curve of the event. We simulate the disruption of a low mass main sequence star by BHs of varying masses ($10^5,10^6,10^7 M_\\odot$) and of a white dwarf by a $10^5 M_\\odot$ BH. Based on the orbital energy as well as angular momentum of the debris, we infer the orbital distribution and estimate the return rate of the debris following the disruption. We find two signatures of relativistic disruptions: a gradual rise as well as a delayed peak in the return rate curves relative to their Newtonian analogs. Assuming that the return rates are proportional to the light curves, we find that relativistic effects are in principle measurable given the cadence and sensitivity of the current transient sky surveys. Accordingly, using a simple model of a relativistic encounter with a Newtonian parametric fit of the peak leads to an overestimate in the BH mass by a factor of $\\sim {\\rm few}\\times0.1$ and $\\sim {\\rm few}$ in the case of the main sequence star and white dwarf tidal disruptions, respectively.

It is found that apart from the conventional critical temperature related to Hawking-Page phase transition there appears an additional critical temperature which is of relevance to the existence of a locally stable tiny black hole; however, the off-shell free energy tells us that this black hole should eventually tunnel into the stable large black hole.

    "abstract": "  There is considerable evidence to suggest that the field equations of gravity have the same status as, say, the equations describing an emergent phenomenon like elasticity. In fact, it is possible to derive the field equations from a thermodynamic variational principle in which a set of normalized vector fields are varied rather than the metric. We show that this variational principle can arise as a low energy ($L_P = (G\\hbar/c^3)^{1/2} \\to 0$) relic of a plausible nonperturbative effect of quantum gravity, viz. the existence of a zero-point-length in the spacetime. Our result is nonperturbative in the following sense: If we modify the geodesic distance in a spacetime by introducing a zero-point-length, to incorporate some effects of quantum gravity, and take the limit $L_P \\to 0$ of the Ricci scalar of the modified metric, we end up getting a nontrivial, leading order ($L_P$ - independent) term. \\textit{This term is identical to the expression for entropy density of spacetime used previously in the emergent gravity approach.} This reconfirms the idea that the microscopic degrees of freedom of the spacetime, when properly described in the full theory, could lead to an effective description of geometry in terms of a thermodynamic variational principle. This is conceptually similar to the emergence of thermodynamics from mechanics of, say, molecules. The approach also has important implications for cosmological constant which are briefly discussed.

    "abstract": "  Starting from the Oppenheimer-Snyder model, we know how in classical general relativity the gravitational collapse of matter form a black hole with a central spacetime singularity. It is widely believed that the singularity must be removed by quantum gravity effects. Some static quantum-inspired singularity-free black hole solutions have been proposed in the literature, but when one considers simple examples of gravitational collapse the classical singularity is replaced by a bounce, after which the collapsing matter expands for ever. We may expect 3 possible explanations: $i)$ the static regular black hole solutions are not physical, in the sense that they cannot be realized in Nature, $ii)$ the final product of the collapse is not unique, but it depends on the initial conditions, or $iii)$ boundary effects play an important role and our simple models miss important physics. In the latter case, after proper adjustment, the bouncing solution would approach the static one. We argue that the \"correct answer\" may be related to the appearance of a ghost state in de Sitter spacetimes with super Planckian mass. Our black holes have indeed a de Sitter core and the ghost would make these configurations unstable. Therefore we believe that these black hole static solutions represent the transient phase of a gravitational collapse, but never survive as asymptotic states. ",

    "abstract": "  The Hamiltonian formulation of Mimetic Gravity is formulated. Although there are two more equations than those of general relativity, these are proved to be the constraint equation and the conservation of energy-momentum tensor. The Poisson brackets are then computed and closure is proved. At the end, Wheeler-DeWitt equation was solved for a homogeneous and isotropic universe. This was done first for a vanishing potential where agreement with the dust case was shown, and then for a constant potential. ",

    "abstract": "  This paper reports on an unmodeled, all-sky search for gravitational waves from merging intermediate mass black hole binaries (IMBHB). The search was performed on data from the second joint science run of the LIGO and Virgo detectors (July 2009 - October 2010) and was sensitive to IMBHBs with a range up to $\\sim 200$ Mpc, averaged over the possible sky positions and inclinations of the binaries with respect to the line of sight. No significant candidate was found. Upper limits on the coalescence-rate density of nonspinning IMBHBs with total masses between 100 and $450 \\ \\mbox{M}_{\\odot}$ and mass ratios between $0.25$ and $1\\,$ were placed by combining this analysis with an analogous search performed on data from the first LIGO-Virgo joint science run (November 2005 - October 2007). The most stringent limit was set for systems consisting of two $88 \\ \\mbox{M}_{\\odot}$ black holes and is equal to $0.12 \\ \\mbox{Mpc}^{-3} \\ \\mbox{Myr}^{-1}$ at the $90\\%$ confidence level. This paper also presents the first estimate, for the case of an unmodeled analysis, of the impact on the search range of IMBHB spin configurations: the visible volume for IMBHBs with nonspinning components is roughly doubled for a population of IMBHBs with spins aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum and uniformly distributed in the dimensionless spin parameter up to 0.8, whereas an analogous population with antialigned spins decreases the visible volume by $\\sim 20\\%\\,$.

    "abstract": "  We study the dependence of the electromagnetic luminosity --produced by interactions of force-free magnetospheres-- on dipole inclinations in binary neutron star systems. We show that this interaction extracts kinetic energy from the system and powers a Poynting flux with a strong dependence on the dipole orientations. This dependence can be linked to the reconnection and redistribution of magnetic field as the stars interact. Although the details of the Poynting luminosity are very much dependent on the orientation, all the cases considered here nevertheless radiate a large Poynting flux. This robust emission suggests that the pre-merger stage of binary neutron star systems can yield interesting electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events. ",

    "abstract": "  If binary black holes form following the successive core collapses of sufficiently massive binary stars, precessional dynamics may align their spins $\\mathbf S_1$ and $\\mathbf S_2$ and the orbital angular momentum $\\mathbf L$ into a plane in which they jointly precess about the total angular momentum $\\mathbf J$. These spin orientations are known as spin-orbit resonances since $\\mathbf S_1$, $\\mathbf S_2$, and $\\mathbf L$ all precess at the same frequency to maintain their planar configuration. Two families of such spin-orbit resonances exist, alike in dignity but differentiated by whether the components of the two spins in the orbital plane are either aligned or antialigned. The fraction of binary black holes in each family is determined by the stellar evolution of their progenitors, so if gravitational-wave detectors could measure this fraction they could provide important insights into astrophysical formation scenarios for binary black holes. In this paper, we show that even under the conservative assumption that binary black holes are observed along the direction of $\\mathbf J$ (where precession-induced modulations to the gravitational waveforms are minimized), the waveforms of many members of each resonant family can be distinguished from all members of the opposing family in events with signal-to-noise ratios $\\rho \\simeq 10$, typical of those expected for the first detections with Advanced LIGO/Virgo. We hope that our preliminary findings inspire a greater appreciation of the capability of gravitational-wave detectors to constrain stellar astrophysics and stimulate further studies of the distinguishability of spin-orbit resonant families in more expanded regions of binary black-hole parameter space.

    "abstract": "  3D Loop Quantum Gravity with a vanishing cosmological constant can be related to the quantization of the $\\textrm{SU}(2)$ BF theory discretized on a lattice. At the classical level, this discrete model characterizes discrete flat geometries and its phase space is built from $T^\\ast \\textrm{SU}(2)$. In a recent paper \\cite{HyperbolicPhaseSpace}, this discrete model was deformed using the Poisson-Lie group formalism and was shown to characterize discrete hyperbolic geometries while being still topological. Hence, it is a good candidate to describe the discretization of $\\textrm{SU}(2)$ BF theory with a (negative) cosmological constant. We proceed here to the quantization of this model. At the kinematical level, the Hilbert space is spanned by spin networks built on $\\mathcal{U}_{q}(\\mathfrak{su}(2))$ (with $q$ real). In particular, the quantization of the discretized Gauss constraint leads naturally to $\\mathcal{U}_{q}(\\mathfrak{su}(2))$ intertwiners. We also quantize the Hamiltonian constraint on a face of degree 3 and show that physical states are proportional to the quantum 6j-symbol. This suggests that the Turaev-Viro amplitude with $q$ real is a solution of the quantum Hamiltonian. This model is therefore a natural candidate to describe 3D loop quantum gravity with a (negative) cosmological constant. ",

Here I find the temperature, Smarr formula and the first law of thermodynamics for the Sultana-Dyer metric which is related to the Schwarzschild spacetime by a time dependent conformal factor. To find the temperature ($T$), the chiral anomaly expressions for the two dimensional spacetime are used. This shows an application of the anomaly method to study Hawking effect for a dynamical situation. Moreover, the analysis singles out one expression for temperature among two existing expressions in the literature. Interestingly, the present form satisfies the first law of thermodynamics. Also, it relates the Misner-Sharp energy ($\\bar{E}$) and the horizon entropy ($\\bar{S}$) by an algebraic expression $\\bar{E}=2\\bar{S}T$ which is the general form of the Smarr formula. This fact is similar to the usual static black hole cases in Einstein's gravity where the energy is identified as the Komar conserved quantity. ",

We discuss how this deformed symmetry framework is generally described by a quantum deformation of the Poincar\\'e group: the quantum double of ${\\rm SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$. We then illustrate how the space of functions on the group manifold momentum space has a dual representation on a non-commutative space of coordinates via a (quantum) group Fourier transform. In this context we explore the connection between Weyl maps and different notions of (quantum) group Fourier transform appeared in the literature in the past years and establish relations between them.

This model in the Jordan frame is conformally equivalent to the Einstein-Weyl gravity in the Einstein frame. The coupled linearized Einstein equation is decomposed into the traceless and trace equation when one chooses $6m^2\\varphi=\\delta R$. Solving the traceless equation exhibits unstable modes featuring the Gregory-Laflamme $s$-mode instability of five-dimensional black string, while we find no unstable modes when solving the trace equation.

The main question arises as to what is origin of emergence of space in 4D universe? We answer to this question in BIonic system. The BIon is a configuration in flat space of a D-brane and a parallel anti-D-brane connected by a thin shell wormhole with F-string charge.

    "abstract": "  Because of their superfluid properties, some compact astrophysical objects such as neutron stars may contain a significant part of their matter in the form of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). We consider a partially-relativistic model of self-gravitating BECs where the relation between the pressure and the rest-mass density is assumed to be quadratic (as in the case of classical BECs) but pressure effects are taken into account in the relation between the energy density and the rest-mass density. At high densities, we get a stiff equation of state similar to the one considered by Zel'dovich (1961) in the context of baryon stars in which the baryons interact through a vector meson field. We determine the maximum mass of general relativistic BEC stars described by this equation of state by using the formalism of Tooper (1965). This maximum mass is slightly larger than the maximum mass obtained by Chavanis and Harko (2012) using a fully-relativistic model. We also consider the possibility that dark matter is made of BECs and apply the partially-relativistic model of BECs to cosmology. In this model, we show that the universe experiences a stiff matter phase, followed by a dust matter phase, and finally by a dark energy phase (equivalent to a cosmological constant). The same evolution is obtained in Zel'dovich (1972) model which assumes that initially, near the cosmological singularity, the universe is filled with cold baryons. Interestingly, the Friedmann equations can be solved analytically in that case and provide a simple generalization of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. We point out, however, the limitations of the partially-relativistic model for BECs and show the need for a fully-relativistic one. ",

    "abstract": "  In the first part of this article I determine the geometry of a slowly rotating black hole deformed by generic tidal forces created by a remote distribution of matter. The metric of the deformed black hole is obtained by integrating the Einstein field equations in a vacuum region of spacetime bounded by r < r_max, with r_max a maximum radius taken to be much smaller than the distance to the remote matter. The tidal forces are assumed to be weak and to vary slowly in time, and the metric is expressed in terms of generic tidal quadrupole moments E_{ab} and B_{ab} that characterize the tidal environment. The metric incorporates couplings between the black hole's spin vector and the tidal moments, and captures all effects associated with the dragging of inertial frames. In the second part of the article I determine the tidal moments by immersing the black hole in a larger post-Newtonian system that includes an external distribution of matter; while the black hole's internal gravity is allowed to be strong, the mutual gravity between the black hole and the external matter is assumed to be weak. The post-Newtonian metric that describes the entire system is valid when r > r_min, where r_min is a minimum distance that must be much larger than the black hole's radius. The black-hole and post-Newtonian metrics provide alternative descriptions of the same gravitational field in an overlap r_min < r < r_max, and matching the metrics determine the tidal moments, which are expressed as post-Newtonian expansions carried out through one-and-a-half post-Newtonian order. Explicit expressions are obtained in the specific case in which the black hole is a member of a post-Newtonian two-body system. ",

This formalism allows us to derive the equation of motion, equations of precession for the spin, and stress-energy tensor of each body in covariant form, and admits a formal generalization to any multipolar order. For spin-induced multipoles, i.e. in the case where the rotation of the compact object is sole responsible for the additional multipole moments, we find a unique structure for the octupolar moment representing cubic-in-spin effects. We apply these results to compute the associated effects in the dynamics of compact binary systems, and deduce the corresponding terms in the energy loss rate due to gravitational waves. These effects enter at the third-and-a-half post-Newtonian order, and can be important for binaries involving rapidly spinning black holes.

    "abstract": "  We present an algorithm for calculating the metric perturbations and gravitational self-force for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with eccentric orbits. The massive black hole is taken to be Schwarzschild and metric perturbations are computed in Lorenz gauge. The perturbation equations are solved as coupled systems of ordinary differential equations in the frequency domain. Accurate local behavior of the metric is attained through use of the method of extended homogeneous solutions and mode-sum regularization is used to find the self-force. We focus on calculating the self-force with sufficient accuracy to ensure its error contributions to the phase in a long term orbital evolution will be $\\delta\\Phi \\lesssim 10^{-2}$ radians. This requires the orbit-averaged force to have fractional errors $\\lesssim 10^{-8}$ and the oscillatory part of the self-force to have errors $\\lesssim 10^{-3}$ (a level frequently easily exceeded). Our code meets this error requirement in the oscillatory part, extending the reach to EMRIs with eccentricities of $e \\lesssim 0.8$, if augmented by use of fluxes for the orbit-averaged force, or to eccentricities of $e \\lesssim 0.5$ when used as a stand-alone code. Further, we demonstrate accurate calculations up to orbital separations of $a \\simeq 100 M$, beyond that required for EMRI models and useful for comparison with post-Newtonian theory. Our principal developments include (1) use of fully constrained field equations, (2) discovery of analytic solutions for even-parity static modes, (3) finding a pre-conditioning technique for outer homogeneous solutions, (4) adaptive use of quad-precision and (5) jump conditions to handle near-static modes, and (6) a hybrid scheme for high eccentricities.

The equations of motion are also solved analytically in the limit of small values of the characteristic length scales associated with the spin and quadrupole with respect to the background curvature characteristic length.

Our study takes into account all excitations of the metric that can potentially drive an instability. There are some subtleties in identifying these modes, as a non-local field theory contains dynamical fields which yet do not correspond to degrees of freedom. Since some of them are ghost-like, we clarify the impact of such modes on the stability of the solutions of interest that are the flat space-time and cosmological solutions. We then find that flat space-time is unstable under scalar perturbations, but the instability manifests itself only at cosmological scales, i.e. out of the region of validity of this solution. It is therefore the stability of the FLRW solution which is relevant there, in which case the scalar perturbations are known to be well-behaved by numerical studies. By finding the analytic solution for the late-time behaviour of the scale factor, which leads to a big rip singularity, we argue that the linear perturbations are bounded in the future because of the domination of Hubble friction. In particular, this effect damps the scalar ghost perturbations which were responsible for destabilizing Minkowski space-time. Thus, the model remains phenomenologically viable. ",

Our approach relies on a new horizon penetrating, hyperboloidal foliation of Kerr spacetime and spatial compactification. In particular, we present a framework for waveform generation from point-particle perturbations. Extensive tests of a time domain implementation in the code {\\it Teukode} are presented. The code can efficiently deliver waveforms at future null infinity. As a first application of the method, we compute the gravitational waveforms from inspiraling and coalescing black-hole binaries in the large-mass-ratio limit. The smaller mass black hole is modeled as a point particle whose dynamics is driven by an effective-one-body-resummed analytical radiation reaction force. We compare the analytical angular momentum loss to the gravitational wave angular momentum flux. We find that higher-order post-Newtonian corrections are needed to improve the consistency for rapidly spinning binaries. Close to merger, the subdominant multipolar amplitudes (notably the $m=0$ ones) are enhanced for retrograde orbits with respect to prograde ones. We argue that this effect mirrors nonnegligible deviations from circularity of the dynamics during the late-plunge and merger phase. We compute the gravitational wave energy flux flowing into the black hole during the inspiral using a time-domain formalism proposed by Poisson. Finally, a self-consistent, iterative method to compute the gravitational wave fluxes at leading-order in the mass of the particle is presented. For a specific case study with $\\hat{a}$=0.9, a simulation that uses the consistent flux differs from one that uses the analytical flux by $\\sim35$ gravitational wave cycles over a total of about $250$ cycles.

In this model the Universe evolves from an early to a late time de Sitter era, with the recent accelerating phase driven only by the negative creation pressure associated with the cold dark matter component. The model can be interpreted as an attempt to reduce the so-called cosmic sector (dark matter plus dark energy) and relate the two cosmic accelerating phases (early and late time de Sitter expansions). A detailed thermodynamic analysis including possible quantum corrections is also carried out. For a very wide range of the free parameters, it is found that the model presents the expected behavior of an ordinary macroscopic system in the sense that it approaches thermodynamic equilibrium in the long run (i.e., as it nears the second de Sitter phase). Moreover, an upper bound is found for the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the primordial de Sitter phase. Finally, when confronted with the recent observational data, the current `quasi'-de Sitter era, as predicted by the model, is seen to pass very comfortably the cosmic background tests. ",

    "abstract": "  This is a continuation of the paper published in {\\it Phys. Rev.} {\\bf D89}, 023520 (2014). It is investigated here how the luminosity distance -- redshift relation $D_L(z)$ of the $\\Lambda$CDM model is duplicated in the Lema\\^{\\i}tre -- Tolman (L--T) model with $\\Lambda = 0$, constant bang-time function $t_B$ and the energy function $E(r)$ mimicking accelerated expansion on the observer's past light cone ($r$ is a uniquely defined comoving radial coordinate). Numerical experiments show that $E > 0$ necessarily. The functions $z(r)$ and $E(r)$ are numerically calculated from the initial point at the observer's position; then backward from the initial point at the apparent horizon (AH). Reconciling the results of the two calculations allows one to determine the values of $E/r^2$ at $r = 0$ and at the AH. The problems connected with continuing the calculation through the AH are discussed in detail and solved. Then $z(r)$ and $E(r)$ are continued beyond the AH, up to the numerical crash that signals the contact of the light cone with the Big Bang. Similarly, the light cone of the L--T model is calculated by proceeding from the two initial points, and compared with the $\\Lambda$CDM light cone. The model constructed here contains shell crossings, but they can be removed by matching the L--T region to a Friedmann background, without causing any conflict with the type Ia supernovae observations. The mechanism of imitating the accelerated expansion by the $E(r)$ function is explained in a descriptive way. ",

Here we show that this cannot in general be the case. We show that the limit of vanishing torsion is not necessarily a continuous one, with the theory obtained in the limit not necessarily coinciding with the theory in which torsion had never been present at all. However, for a standard torsion tensor that is antisymmetric in two of its indices we have found two cases in which the vanishing torsion limit is in fact continuous, namely Einstein gravity and conformal gravity. For other gravity theories of common interest to possess a continuous limit the torsion tensor would need to be antisymmetric in all three of its indices. ",

    "abstract": "  In dense stellar regions, highly eccentric binaries of black holes and neutron stars can form through various n-body interactions. Such a binary could emit a significant fraction of its binding energy in a sequence of largely isolated gravitational wave bursts prior to merger. Given expected black hole and neutron star masses, many such systems will emit these repeated bursts at frequencies within the sensitive band of contemporary ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Unfortunately, existing gravitational wave searches are ill-suited to detect these signals. In this work, we adapt a \"power stacking\" method to the detection of gravitational wave signals from highly eccentric binaries. We implement this method as an extension of the Q-transform, a projection onto a multiresolution basis of windowed complex exponentials that has previously been used to analyze data from the network of LIGO/Virgo detectors. Our method searches for excess power over an ensemble of time-frequency tiles. We characterize the performance of our method using Monte Carlo experiments with signals injected in simulated detector noise. Our results indicate that the power stacking method achieves substantially better sensitivity to eccentric binary signals than existing localized burst searches. ",

    "abstract": "  Many relevant applications in gravitational wave physics share a significant common problem: the seven-dimensional parameter space of gravitational waveforms from precessing compact binary inspirals and coalescences is large enough to prohibit covering the space of waveforms with sufficient density. We find that by using the reduced basis method together with a parametrization of waveforms based on their phase and precession, we can construct ultra-compact yet high-accuracy representations of this large space. As a demonstration, we show that less than $100$ judiciously chosen precessing inspiral waveforms are needed for $200$ cycles, mass ratios from $1$ to $10$ and spin magnitudes $\\le 0.9$. In fact, using only the first $10$ reduced basis waveforms yields a maximum mismatch of $0.016$ over the whole range of considered parameters. We test whether the parameters selected from the inspiral regime result in an accurate reduced basis when including merger and ringdown; we find that this is indeed the case in the context of a non-precessing effective-one-body model. This evidence suggests that as few as $\\sim 100$ numerical simulations of binary black hole coalescences may accurately represent the seven-dimensional parameter space of precession waveforms for the considered ranges.

For known millisecond pulsars the observed spindown rate imposes an upper limit on the possible gravitational wave signal of these sources. Taking into account the physics of r-mode evolution, we show that only sources spinning at frequencies above a few hundred Hertz can be unstable to r-modes, and we derive a more stringent universal r-mode spindown limit on their gravitational wave signal, exploiting the fact that the r-mode saturation amplitude is insensitive to the structural properties of individual sources. We find that this refined bound limits the gravitational wave strain from millisecond pulsars to values below the detection sensitivity of next-generation detectors. Young sources are therefore a more promising option for the detection of gravitational waves emitted by r-modes and to probe the interior composition of compact stars in the near future. ",

We suggest that a second order phase transition observed in the Causal Dynamical Triangulations approach to quantum gravity may have a cosmological relevance. The phase transition interpolates between a non-geometric crumpled phase of gravity, and an extended phase with classical properties. Transitions of this kind have been postulated earlier in the context of geometrogenesis in Quantum Graphity. We show that critical behavior may also be associated with a signature change event in Loop Quantum Cosmology. In both cases, classical spacetime originates at the critical point associated with a second order phase transition. ",

This is possible according to the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT). I also show that by using this method new features of quantum field theory not visible in the previous treatments emerge. The main argument is that several constructions considered as absolute until now may appear as relative, depending on individual choices of group structures needed to probe a topology. The universal coefficient theorem also gives information about how these structures as measured by different choices of groups, relate to each other. This may result in the formulation of new dualities and a deeper understanding of the relation between quantum field theories and gravity. ",

We define a conserved renormalized energy-momentum tensor by means of a comoving cutoff regularization. Using exact solutions for de Sitter space-time, we show that in a certain range of mass and renormalization scales there is a contribution to the vacuum energy density that scales as nonrelativistic matter and that such a contribution becomes dominant at late times. By means of the WKB approximation, we find that these results can be extended to arbitrary Robertson-Walker geometries. We study the range of parameters in which the vacuum energy density would be compatible with current limits on dark matter abundance. Finally, by calculating the vacuum energy in a perturbed Robertson-Walker background, we obtain the speed of sound of density perturbations and show that the vacuum energy density contrast can grow on sub-Hubble scales as in standard cold dark matter scenarios.

One such coupling is the product of the inflaton to the Pontryagin density, as in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity.

    "abstract": "  The Eddington-inspired-Born-Infeld scenario (EiBI) can prevent the Big Bang singularity for a matter content whose equation of state is constant and positive. In a recent paper we showed that, on the contrary, it is impossible to smooth a big rip in the EiBI setup. In fact the situations are still different for other singularities. In this paper we show that a big freeze singularity in general relativity (GR) can in some cases be smoothed to a sudden or a type IV singularity under the EiBI scenario. Similarly, a sudden or a type IV singularity in GR can be replaced in some regions of the parameter space by a type IV singularity or a loitering behaviour, respectively, in the EiBI framework. Furthermore, we find that the auxiliary metric related to the physical connection usually has a smoother behaviour than that based on the physical metric. In addition, we show that bound structures close to a big rip or a little rip will be destroyed before the advent of the singularity and will remain bound close to a sudden, big freeze or type IV singularity. We then constrain the model following a cosmographic approach, which is well-known to be model-independent, for a given Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker geometry. It turns out that among the various past or present singularities, the cosmographic analysis can pick up the physical region that determines the occurrence of a type IV singularity or a loitering effect in the past. Moreover, to determine which of the future singularities or doomsdays is more probable, observational constraints on higher order cosmographic parameters is required. ",

In the first part of this series we established the well posedness of the characteristic problem, whereas in the second part we studied the stability of the radius function at the Cauchy horizon.   In this third and final paper we show that, depending on the decay rate of the initial data, mass inflation may or may not occur. When the mass is controlled, it is possible to obtain continuous extensions of the metric across the Cauchy horizon with square integrable Christoffel symbols. Under slightly stronger conditions, we can bound the gradient of the scalar field. This allows the construction of (non-isometric) extensions of the maximal development which are classical solutions of the Einstein equations.

    "abstract": "  The conformal method is a technique for finding Cauchy data in general relativity solving the Einstein constraint equations, and its parameters include a conformal class, a conformal momentum (as measured by a densitized lapse), and a mean curvature. Although the conformal method is successful in generating constant mean curvature (CMC) solutions of the constraint equations, it is unknown how well it applies in the non-CMC setting, and there have been indications that it encounters difficulties there. We are therefore motivated to investigate alternative generalizations of the CMC conformal method.   Introducing a densitized lapse into the ADM Lagrangian, we find that solutions of the momentum constraint can be described in terms of three parameters. The first is conformal momentum as it appears in the standard conformal method. The second is volumetric momentum, which appears as an explicit parameter in the CMC conformal method, but not in the non-CMC formulation. We have called the third parameter drift momentum, and it is the conjugate momentum to infinitesimal motions in superspace that preserve conformal class and volume form up to independent diffeomorphisms. This decomposition of solutions of the momentum constraint leads to extensions of the CMC conformal method where conformal and volumetric momenta both appear as parameters. There is more than one way to treat drift momentum, in part because of an interesting duality that emerges, and we identify three candidates for incorporating drift into a variation of the conformal method.

We construct solutions for rapidly rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, a useful and motivated example of a post-GR correction. We treat dCS as an effective theory and thus work in the decoupling limit, where we apply a perturbation scheme using the Kerr metric as the background solution. Using the solutions to the scalar field and the trace of the metric perturbation, we determine the regime of validity of our perturbative approach. We find that the maximal spin limit may be divergent, and the decoupling limit is strongly restricted for rapid rotation.

(AMPS) can be resolved if matter does not undergo continuous collapse to a singularity but condenses on the apparent horizon. One can then expect a quasi-static object to form even after the gravitational field has overcome any degeneracy pressure of the matter fields. We consider dust collapse. If the collapse terminates on the apparent horizon, the Misner-Sharp mass function of the dust ball is predicted and we construct static solutions with no tangential pressure that would represent such a compact object. The collapse wave functions indicate that there will be processes by which energy extraction from the center occurs. These leave behind a negative point mass at the center which contributes to the total energy of the system but has no effect on the the energy density of the dust ball. The solutions describe a compact object whose boundary lies outside its Schwarzschild radius and which is hardly distinguishable from a neutron star. ",

As a consequence the radiation emitted close to the apparent horizon no longer arrives at infinity with a diverging redshift. Standard calculations of the emission of Hawking radiation then indicate that no blackbody radiation is emitted to infinity by the black hole in these circumstances, hence there will also then be no black hole evaporation process due to emission of such radiation as long as the matter flux is significant. The essential adiabatic condition (eikonal approximation) for black hole radiation gives a strong limit to the black holes that can emit Hawking radiation. We give the mass range for the black holes that can radiate, according to their cosmological redshift, for the special case of the cosmic blackbody radiation (CBR) influx (which exists everywhere in the universe). At a very late stage of black hole formation when the CBR influx decays away, the black hole horizon becomes first a slowly evolving horizon and then an isolated horizon; at that stage, black hole radiation will start. This study suggests that the primordial black hole evaporation scenario should be revised to take these considerations into account. ",

Since we show that the polymeric effects only change the number of microstates of a statistical system, working in this coordinate is quite reasonable from the statistical point of view. The results show that the number of microstates decreases due to existence of an upper bound for the momentum of the test particles in the polymer framework. We obtain a corresponding canonical partition function by means of the deformed density of states. By using the partition function, we study thermodynamics of the ideal gas in the polymer framework and show that our results are in good agreement with those that arise from the full quantum consideration at high temperature, and they coincide with their usual counterpart in the limit of low temperature.

Particularly for the extremal rotating regular ABG BH, CM energy of two colliding particles could be arbitrarily high for critical angular momentum of particles.

In the Madelung representation of the wave function, the quantum dynamics of the condensate can be formulated in terms of the classical continuity equation and the hydrodynamic Euler equations. In the case of a condensate with quartic nonlinearity, the condensates can be described as a gas with two pressure terms, the interaction pressure, which is proportional to the square of the matter density, and the quantum pressure, which is without any classical analogue though, when the number of particles in the system is high enough, the latter may be neglected. By assuming cylindrical symmetry, we analyze the physical properties of the BEC strings in both the interaction pressure and quantum pressure dominated limits, by numerically integrating the gravitational field equations. In this way we obtain a large class of stable stringlike astrophysical objects, whose basic parameters (mass density and radius) depend sensitively on the mass and scattering length of the condensate particle, as well as on the quantum pressure of the Bose-Einstein gas.

This remarkable duality, formulated in 1997, has sparked a vigorous research program which has gained in breadth over the years, with applications to many aspects of theoretical (and even experimental) physics, not least to general relativity and quantum gravity. To put the AdS/CFT correspondence in historical context, we start by reviewing the relevant aspects of string theory (of which no prior knowledge is assumed). We then develop the statement of the correspondence, and explain how the two sides of the duality map into each other. Finally, we discuss the implications and applications of the correspondence, and indicate some of the current trends in this subject.

We consider a state in which a single \"atom\" is added to an otherwise homogeneous condensate.

    "abstract": "  SgrA$^*$, the supermassive black hole candidate at the center of our Galaxy, seems to be one of the most promising object to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis with near future observations. In a few years, it will hopefully be possible to measure a number of relativistic effects around this body, and the combination of different observations can be used to constrain possible deviations from the Kerr solution. In this paper, I discuss the combination of three promising techniques in the framework of the Cardoso-Pani-Rico parametrization: the observation of blobs of plasma orbiting near the innermost stable circular orbit, the detection of the black hole shadow, and timing observations of a radio pulsar in a compact orbit. The observations of blobs of plasma and of the shadow can probe the strong gravitational field around SgrA$^*$, while the radio pulsar would be sensitive to the weak field region at larger radii. In the case of a fast-rotating object, the combination of the three measurements could provide strong constraints on the actual nature of SgrA$^*$. For a non-rotating or slow-rotating object, the bounds would be weak. ",

As an application, we study static charged ($D+1$)-dimensional spacetimes in the framework of the healthy (non-projectable) Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity in the infrared limit, and find various solutions. Some of them represent Lifshitz space-times with hyperscaling violations, and some have black hole structures. In the latter universal horizons always exist inside the Killing horizons. The surface gravity on them can be either larger or smaller than the surface gravity on the Killing horizons, depending on the space-times considered. Although such black holes are found only in the infrared, we argue that black holes with universal horizons also exist in the full theory of the HL gravity. A simple example is the Schwarzschild solution written in the Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates, which is also a solution of the full theory of the HL gravity and has a universal horizon located inside the Schwarzschild Killing horizon.

    "abstract": "  Compact binaries that emit gravitational waves in the sensitivity band of ground-based detectors can have non-negligible eccentricities just prior to merger, depending on the formation scenario. We develop a purely analytic, frequency-domain model for gravitational waves emitted by compact binaries on orbits with small eccentricity, which reduces to the quasi-circular post-Newtonian approximant TaylorF2 at zero eccentricity and to the post-circular approximation of Yunes et al. (2009) at small eccentricity. Our model uses a spectral approximation to the (post-Newtonian) Kepler problem to model the orbital phase as a function of frequency, accounting for eccentricity effects up to ${\\cal{O}}(e^8)$ at each post-Newtonian order. Our approach accurately reproduces an alternative time-domain eccentric waveform model for eccentricities $e\\in [0, 0.4]$ and binaries with total mass less than 12 solar masses. As an application, we evaluate the signal amplitude that eccentric binaries produce in different networks of existing and forthcoming gravitational waves detectors. Assuming a population of eccentric systems containing black holes and neutron stars that is uniformly distributed in co-moving volume, we estimate that second generation detectors like Advanced LIGO could detect approximately 0.1-10 events per year out to redshift $z\\sim 0.2$, while an array of Einstein Telescope detectors could detect hundreds of events per year to redshift $z \\sim 2.3$.

Suppose there exists a highly perturbed region which will collapse to form a PBH after the horizon crossing of this region, and farther that this region is superposed on much larger region, which also collapses upon reentry. One then expects the collapse of the central smaller region at the time of the crossing of this region, followed by another collapse of the larger perturbation at the time of its respective crossing. The smaller PBH, formed earlier, should be swallowed in the second collapse leading to a single larger PBH as the final state. This paper reports the first direct numerical confirmation of such double PBH formation. Related to this, we also discuss the effects of high-frequency modes on the formation of PBHs. ",

These are the three fundamental assumptions underlying Black Hole Complementarity and the authors proposed that the most conservative resolution of the paradox is that (c) is false and the infalling observer burns up at the horizon (the horizon acts as a \"firewall\"). However, the firewall violates the equivalence principle and breaks the CPT invariance of quantum gravity. This led Hawking to propose recently that gravitational collapse may not end up producing event horizons, although he did not give a mechanism for how this may happen. Here we will support Hawking's conclusion in a quantum gravitational model of dust collapse. We will show that continued collapse to a singularity can only be achieved by combining two independent and entire solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We interpret the paradox as simply forbidding such a combination, which leads naturally to a picture in which matter condenses on the apparent horizon during quantum collapse. ",

As a result, the position of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) becomes closer to the horizon. When the Lorentz force is repulsive (directed from the black hole) the ISCO radius can reach the gravitational radius. In the process of accretion charged particles (ions) of the accreting matter can be accumulated near their ISCO, while neutral particles fall down to the black hole after they reach $6M$ radius. The sharp spectral line Fe K$\\alpha$, emitted by iron ions at such orbits, is broadened when the emission is registered by a distant observer.

We elaborate a regular source of the KN solution which satisfies the requirement of flat space-time inside the source and realization of the exact KN solution outside the source. This requirement removes conflict between gravity and quantum theory and determines many details of the source structure. In particular, we obtain that the KN source should forms a gravitating bag model, similar to the known MIT and SLAC bag models. As opposite to the known bag models, the self-interacting Higgs field should be confined inside the bag, while outside the bag the gauge symmetry should be unbroken to provide the external KN gravity. We show that twistorial structure of the Kerr geometry (the Kerr theorem) determines structure of the Dirac equation, resulting in a variable mass term, which is generated inside the bag through interaction with the confined Higgs field. Similar to the other bag models, ellipsoidal deformations of the KN bag creates a string-like structure of the dressed electron -- circular string positioned along perimeter of the KN bag. ",

Yet some (including Einstein) have questioned that presumption, whose empirical basis is weak. Indeed, recently Freeman Dyson has emphasized that no conventional experiment is capable of detecting individual gravitons. However, as we describe, if inflation occurred, the Universe, by acting as an ideal graviton amplifier, affords such access. It produces a classical signal, in the form of macroscopic gravitational waves, in response to spontaneous (not induced) emission of gravitons. Thus recent BICEP2 observations of polarization in the cosmic microwave background will, if confirmed, provide empirical evidence for the quantization of gravity. Their details also support quantitative ideas concerning the unification of strong, electromagnetic, and weak forces, and of all these with gravity. ",

More concretely, the fields coupled in this manner exhibit a complex interaction, mediated by the time derivative of the Hubble parameter. Our investigation is supported by means of a suitable choice of potentials, employing numerical methods and analytical approximations. In more detail, the oscillations on the small field limit become correlated, and one field is intertwined with the other. In this type of solution, a varying sound speed is present, together with the generation of isocurvature perturbations. The mentioned features allow to consider an interesting model, to test against observation. It is subsequently shown how our results are consistent with current CMB data (viz.Planck and BICEP2). ",

    "abstract": "  The population of stellar-mass, compact object binaries that merge with non-negligible eccentricity may be large enough to motivate searches with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Such events could be exceptional laboratories to test General Relativity in the dynamical, strong-field regime, as a larger fraction of the energy is emitted at high-velocities, compared to quasi-circular inspirals. A serious obstacle here, however, is the challenge of computing theoretical waveforms for eccentric systems with the requisite accuracy for use in a matched-filter search. The corresponding waveforms are more a sequence of concentrated bursts of energy emitted near periapse than a continuous waveform. Based on this, an alternative approach, stacking excess power over the set of time-frequency tiles coincident with the bursts, was recently suggested as a more practical (though sub-optimal) detection strategy. The leading-order \"observable\" that would be inferred from such a detection would be a sequence of discrete numbers characterizing the position and size of each time-frequency tile. In General Relativity, this (possibly large) sequence of numbers is uniquely determined by the small set of parameters describing the binary at formation. In this work, following the spirit of the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework developed for quasi-circular inspiral, we propose a simple, parameterized deformation of the baseline general relativistic burst algorithm for eccentric inspiral events that would allow for model-independent tests of Einstein's theory in this high-velocity, strong-field regime.

Corrections could in principle be significant even in certain low-curvature regimes, provided that they add up during long cosmic evolution. The analysis of such terms is therefore an important problem to make sure that the theory shows acceptable semiclassical behavior. This paper presents a general search for terms of this type as corrections in effective equations for a k=0 isotropic quantum cosmological model with a free, massless scalar field. Specifically, the question of whether such models can show a collapse by quantum effects is studied, and it turns out that factor-ordering choices in the Hamiltonian constraint are especially relevant in this regard. A systematic analysis of factor-ordering ambiguities in effective equations is therefore developed. ",

We investigate solutions of multibranes too. The presence of solutions may indicate the semiclassical instability of the models. ",

    "abstract": "  Within the context of scalar-tensor gravity, we explore the generalized second law (GSL) of gravitational thermodynamics. We extend the action of ordinary scalar-tensor gravity theory to the case in which there is a non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and the matter field (as chameleon field). Then, we derive the field equations governing the gravity and the scalar field. For a FRW universe filled only with ordinary matter, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations as well as the evolution equation of the scalar field. Furthermore, we assume the boundary of the universe to be enclosed by the dynamical apparent horizon which is in thermal equilibrium with the Hawking temperature. We obtain a general expression for the GSL of thermodynamics in the scalar-tensor gravity model. For some viable scalar-tensor models, we first obtain the evolutionary behaviors of the matter density, the scale factor, the Hubble parameter, the scalar field, the deceleration parameter as well as the effective equation of state (EoS) parameter. We conclude that in most of the models, the deceleration parameter approaches a de Sitter regime at late times, as expected. Also the effective EoS parameter acts like the LCDM model at late times. Finally, we examine the validity of the GSL for the selected models. ",

    "abstract": "  In this paper we analyze the Kerr geometry in the context of Conformal Gravity, an alternative theory of gravitation, which is a direct extension of General Relativity. Following previous studies in the literature, we introduce an explicit expression of the Kerr metric in Conformal Gravity, which naturally reduces to the standard General Relativity Kerr geometry in the absence of Conformal Gravity effects. As in the standard case, we show that the Hamilton-Jacobi equation governing geodesic motion in a space-time based on this geometry is indeed separable and that a fourth constant of motion-similar to Carter's constant-can also be introduced in Conformal Gravity. Consequently, we derive the fundamental equations of geodesic motion and show that the problem of solving these equations can be reduced to one of quadratures. In particular, we study the resulting time-like geodesics in Conformal Gravity Kerr geometry by numerically integrating the equations of motion for Earth flyby trajectories of spacecraft. We then compare our results with the existing data of the Flyby Anomaly in order to ascertain whether Conformal Gravity corrections are possibly the origin of this gravitational anomaly. Although Conformal Gravity slightly affects the trajectories of geodesic motion around a rotating spherical object, we show that these corrections are minimal and are not expected to be the origin of the Flyby Anomaly, unless conformal parameters are drastically different from current estimates. Therefore, our results confirm previous analyses, showing that modifications due to Conformal Gravity are not likely to be detected at the Solar System level, but might affect gravity at the galactic or cosmological scale.

Importantly, we make explicit the dependencies and scales involved in this problem, particularly the ADM mass, the depth, and the CMC reference hypersurface. Several notions of independent interest are introduced in the course of our analysis, including the notion of depth of a manifold and a scaled version of the flat-distance, the D-flat distance as we call it, which involves the diameter of the manifold.

Clusters of galaxies appear as point sources to a network of ground based laser interferometric detectors. The optimal search strategy for these sources is a \"directed radiometer search\". We show that the flux of SGWB created by the millisecond pulsars in the Virgo cluster produces a significantly stronger signal than the nearly isotropic background of unresolved sources of the same kind. We compute their strain power spectra for different cosmologies and distribution of population over redshifts. We conclude that a localised source, like the Virgo cluster, can be resolved from the isotropic background with very high significance using the directed search algorithm.

This is a configuration space for GR; knowledge of configuration spaces is useful as regards dynamics and QM.In this Article I consider furthmore generalized configuration spaces to all levels within the conventional `equipped sets' paradigm of mathematical structure used in fundamental Theoretical Physics. This covers A) the more familiar issue of topology change in the sense of topological manifolds (tied to cobordisms), including via pinched manifolds. B) The less familiar issue of not regarding as fixed the yet deeper levels of structure: topological spaces themselves (and their metric space subcase), collections of subsets and sets. Isham has previously presented quantization schemes for a number of these. I consider some classical preliminaries for this program, aside from the most obvious (classical dynamics for each). Rather, I provide I) to all levels Relational and Background Independence criteria, which have Problem of Time facets as consequences. I demonstrate that many of these issues descend all the way down, whilst also documenting at which level the others cease to apply. II) Probability theory on configuration spaces. In fact such a stochastic treatment is how to further mathematize the hitherto fairly formal and sketchy subject of records theory (a type of formultion of quantum gravity). Along these lines I provide a number of further examples of records theories. This is in addition to Kendall's shape statistics being the example corresponding to relational mechanics models. To this example I now add 1) Cech cohomology, 2) Kendall's random sets, 3) the lattice of topologies on a fixed set.

The calculation, although non-perturbative in the gravitational constant, is surprisingly simple and yields explicit formulae --in terms of multidimensional integrals-- for the frequency and angular distribution of the radiation. In the range $ b^{-1} < \\omega < (GE)^{-1}$, the GW spectrum behaves like $ \\log (1/GE\\omega) d \\omega$, is confined to cones of angular sizes (around the deflected particle trajectories) ranging from $O(\\theta)$ to $O(1/\\omega b)$, and exactly reproduces, at its lower end, a well-known zero-frequency limit.   At $\\omega > (GE)^{-1}$ the radiation is confined to cones of angular size of order $\\theta (GE\\omega)^{-1/2}$ resulting in a scale-invariant ($d\\omega/\\omega$) spectrum. The total efficiency in GW production is dominated by this \"high frequency\" region and is formally logarithmically divergent in the UV. If the spectrum is cutoff at the limit of validity of our approximations (where a conjectured bound on GW power is also saturated), the fraction of incoming energy radiated away turns out to be $\\frac{1}{ \\pi} \\theta ^2 \\log \\theta^{-2}$ at leading logarithmic accuracy.

    "abstract": "  It is logically possible that regularly evaporating black holes exist in nature. In fact, the prevalent theoretical view is that these are indeed the real objects behind the curtain in astrophysical scenarios. There are several proposals for regularizing the classical singularity of black holes so that their formation and evaporation do not lead to information-loss problems. One characteristic is shared by most of these proposals: these regularly evaporating black holes present long-lived trapping horizons, with absolutely enormous evaporation lifetimes in whatever measure. Guided by the discomfort with these enormous and thus inaccessible lifetimes, we elaborate here on an alternative regularization of the classical singularity, previously proposed by the authors in an emergent gravity framework, which leads to a completely different scenario. In our scheme the collapse of a stellar object would result in a genuine time-symmetric bounce, which in geometrical terms amounts to the connection of a black-hole geometry with a white-hole geometry in a regular manner. The two most differential characteristics of this proposal are: i) the complete bouncing geometry is a solution of standard classical general relativity everywhere except in a transient region that necessarily extends beyond the gravitational radius associated with the total mass of the collapsing object; and ii) the duration of the bounce as seen by external observers is very brief (fractions of milliseconds for neutron-star-like collapses). This scenario motivates the search for new forms of stellar equilibrium different from black holes. In a brief epilogue we compare our proposal with a similar geometrical setting recently proposed by Haggard and Rovelli. ",

    "abstract": "  In the case of general relativity one can interpret the Noether charge in any bulk region as the heat content $TS$ of its boundary surface. Further, the time evolution of spacetime metric in Einstein's theory arises due to the difference $(N_{sur}-N_{bulk})$ of suitably defined surface and bulk degrees of freedom. We show that this thermodynamic interpretation generalizes in a natural fashion to all Lanczos-Lovelock models of gravity. The Noether charge, related to time evolution vector field, in a bulk region of space is equal to the heat content $TS$ of the boundary surface with the temperature $T$ defined using local Rindler observers and $S$ being the Wald entropy. Using the Wald entropy to define the surface degrees of freedom $N_{sur}$ and Komar energy density to define the bulk degrees of freedom $N_{bulk}$, we can also show that the time evolution of the geometry is sourced by $(N_{sur}-N_{bulk})$. When it is possible to choose the foliation of spacetime such that metric is independent of time, the above dynamical equation yields the holographic equipartition for Lanczos-Lovelock gravity with $N_{sur}=N_{bulk}$.

Coupling of the field nonminimally to the torsion scalar destroys the Lorentz invariance of the theory in the sense that the resulting equations of motion depend on the choice of a tetrad. For the assumed static spherically symmetric spacetime, we find a tetrad which leads to a self-consistent set of equations, and we construct the self-gravitating configurations of the scalar field---boson stars. The resulting configurations develop anisotropic principal pressures and satisfy the dominant energy condition. An interesting property of the configurations obtained with sufficiently large field-to-torsion coupling constant is the outwardly increasing energy density, followed by an abrupt drop towards the usual asymptotic tail.

A kind of Born-Oppenheimer ansatz is employed to extract the dynamics of the inhomogeneous perturbations, separating them from the degrees of freedom of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry. With this ansatz, we derive an approximate Schr\\\"odinger equation for the cosmological perturbations and study its range of validity.

    "abstract": "  In recent years, numerical simulations with Gaussian initial states have demonstrated the existence of a quantum bounce in loop quantum cosmology in various models. A key issue pertaining to the robustness of the bounce and the associated physics is to understand the quantum evolution for more general initial states which may depart significantly from Gaussianity and may have no well defined peakedness properties. The analysis of such states, including squeezed and highly non-Gaussian states, has been computationally challenging until now. In this manuscript, we overcome these challenges by using the Chimera scheme for the spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic model sourced with a massless scalar field. We demonstrate that the quantum bounce in this model occurs even for states which are highly squeezed or are non-Gaussian with multiple peaks and with little resemblance to semi-classical states. The existence of the bounce is found to be robust, being independent of the properties of the states. The evolution of squeezed and non-Gaussian states turns out to be qualitatively similar to that of Gaussian states, and satisfies strong constraints on the growth of the relative fluctuations across the bounce. We also compare the results from the effective dynamics and find that, although it captures the qualitative aspects of the evolution for squeezed and highly non-Gaussian states, it always underestimates the bounce volume. We show that various properties of the evolution, such as the energy density at the bounce, are in excellent agreement with the predictions from an exactly solvable loop quantum cosmological model for arbitrary states.

Here we show that the KS representation displays the following properties which are the exact counterparts of LQG ones: (i) the abelian $*$ algebra of $SU(2)$ holonomies and `$U(1)$' background exponentials can be completed to a $C^*$ algebra (ii) the space of semianalytic $SU(2)$ connections is topologically dense in the spectrum of this algebra (iii) there exists a measure on this spectrum for which the KS Hilbert space is realised as the space of square integrable functions on the spectrum (iv) the spectrum admits a characterization as a projective limit of finite numbers of copies of $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$ (v) the algebra underlying the KS representation is constructed from cylindrical functions and their derivations in exactly the same way as the LQG (holonomy-flux) algebra except that the KS cylindrical functions depend on the holonomies and the background exponentials, this extra dependence being responsible for the differences between the KS and LQG algebras.

These orbits pass very close to the center and are qualitatively different from orbits around a Kerr black hole. Should such orbits be observed, they would put stringent constraints on astrophysical compact objects like the Galactic center. ",

Along with a series of simple conditions, we show that the Germani-Maartens solution with a constant density sets up the upper bound for the compactness of that particular class of brane stars. The general demonstration is based upon the properties of the interior solutions of the stars, although we also show that the minimal setup implies a Schwarzschild exterior. ",

    "abstract": "  Within an algebraic framework, used to construct the induced-matter-theory (IMT) setting, in $(D+1)$-dimensional Brans-Dicke (BD) scenario, we obtain a modified BD theory (MBDT) in $D$ dimensions. Being more specific, from the $(D+1)$-dimensional field equations, a $D$--dimensional BD theory, bearing new features, is extracted by means of a suitable dimensional reduction onto a hypersurface orthogonal to the extra dimension. In particular, the BD scalar field in such $D$-dimensional theory has a self-interacting potential, which can be suitably interpreted as produced by the extra dimension. Subsequently, as an application to cosmology, we consider an extended spatially flat FLRW geometry in a $(D+1)$-dimensional space-time. After obtaining the power-law solutions in the bulk, we proceed to construct the corresponding physics, by means of the induced MBDT procedure, on the $D$-dimensional hypersurface. We then contrast the resulted solutions (for different phases of the universe) with those usually extracted from the conventional GR and BD theories in view of current ranges for cosmological parameters. We show that the induced perfect fluid background and the induced scalar potential can be employed, within some limits, for describing different epochs of the universe. Finally, we comment on the observational viability of such a model. ",

    "abstract": "  The paper deals with the mechanism of particle creation in the framework of irreversible thermodynamics. The second order non-equilibrium thermodynamical prescription of Israel and Stewart has been presented with particle creation rate, treated as dissipative effect. In the background of flat FRW model, we assume the non-equilibrium thermodynamical process to be isentropic so that the entropy per particle does not change and consequently the dissipative pressure can be expressed linearly to the particle creation rate. Here the dissipative pressure behaves as a dynamical variable having non-linear inhomogeneous evolution equation and the entropy flow vector satisfies the second law of thermodynamics. Further, using the Friedmann equations and by proper choice of the particle creation rate as a function of the Hubble parameter, it is possible to show (separately) a transition from the inflationary phase to the radiation era and also from matter dominated era to late time acceleration. Also it is found that in the de Sitter phase, the comoving entropy increases exponentially with time, keeping entropy per particle unchanged. Subsequently, the above cosmological scenarios has been described from field theoretic point of view by introducing a scalar field having self interacting potential. Finally, we make an attempt to show the cosmological phenomenon of particle creation as Hawking radiation, particularly during the inflationary era. ",

Besides, we provide a spacetime interpretation of the field equations as those corresponding to a scalar field in a cosmological spacetime that is conformally ultrastatic. In addition, in the privileged Fock quantization, we investigate the generalization of the evolution of physical states from the hyperbolic dynamical regime to an elliptic regime. In order to do this, we contemplate the possibility of processes with signature change in the spacetime where the field propagates and discuss the behavior of the background geometry when the change happens, proving that the spacetime metric degenerates.

We explore the properties of the curvature scalar and stress-energy tensor for all types of rotating regular solutions we can generate without restricting ourselves to specific examples of regular solutions (regular black holes or wormholes). We show through examples how it is generally possible to generate an imperfect fluid regular rotating solution via radial coordinate transformations. We derive rotating wormholes that are modeled as imperfect fluids and discuss their physical properties that are independent on the way the stress-energy tensor is interpreted. A solution modeling an imperfect fluid rotating loop black hole is briefly discussed. We then specialize to the recently discussed stable exotic dust Ellis wormhole emerged in a source-free radial electric or magnetic field, generate its, conjecturally stable, rotating counterpart which turns out to be an exotic imperfect fluid wormhole and determine the stress-energy tensor of both the imperfect fluid and the electric or magnetic field.

    "abstract": "  It is possible to construct artificial spacetime geometries for light by using intense laser pulses that modify the spatiotemporal properties of an optical medium. Here we theoretically investigate experimental possibilities for studying spacetime metrics of the form $\\textrm{d}s^2=c^2\\textrm{d}t^2-\\eta(t)^2\\textrm{d}x^2$. By tailoring the laser pulse shape and medium properties, it is possible to create a refractive index variation $n=n(t)$ that can be identified with $\\eta(t)$. Starting from a perturbative solution to a generalised Hopfield model for the medium described by an $n=n(t)$ we provide estimates for the number of photons generated by the time-dependent spacetime. The simplest example is that of a uniformly varying $\\eta(t)$ that therefore describes the Robertson-Walker metric, i.e. a cosmological expansion. The number of photon pairs generated in experimentally feasible conditions appears to be extremely small. However, large photon production can be obtained by periodically modulating the medium and thus resorting to a resonant enhancement similar to that observed in the dynamical Casimir effect. Curiously, the spacetime metric in this case closely resembles that of a gravitational wave. Motivated by this analogy we show that a periodic gravitational wave can indeed act as an amplifier for photons. The emission for an actual gravitational wave will be very weak but should be readily observable in the laboratory analogue. ",

We extend Akbar--Cai derivation [hep-th/0609128] of Friedmann equations to accommodate a general entropy-area law. Studying the resulted Friedmann equations using a specific entropy-area law, which is motivated by the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), reveals the existence of a maximum energy density closed to Planck density. Allowing for a general continuous pressure $p(\\rho,a)$ leads to bounded curvature invariants and a general nonsingular evolution. In this case, the maximum energy density is reached in a finite time and there is no cosmological evolution beyond this point which leaves the big bang singularity inaccessible from a spacetime prospective. The existence of maximum energy density and a general nonsingular evolution is independent of the equation of state and the spacial curvature $k$. As an example we study the evolution of the equation of state $p=\\omega \\rho$ through its phase-space diagram to show the existence of a maximum energy which is reachable in a finite time. ",

We show that the Lagrangian constraint on the determinant of the metric required by unimodular gravity leads to an extra constraint on the gauge freedom of the metric perturbations. Although the main equation of motion for the gravitational potential remains the same, the shift variable, which is gauge artifact in General Relativity, cannot be set to zero in unimodular gravity. This non-vanishing shift variable affects the propagation of photons throughout the cosmological evolution and therefore modifies the Sachs-Wolfe relation between the relativistic gravitational potential and the microwave temperature anisotropies. However, for adiabatic fluctuations the difference between the result in General Relativity and unimodular gravity is suppressed on large angular scales.

We study a minisuperspace model together with a homogeneous scalar field, for which we can solve the Hamiltonian constraint exactly and arrive at an explicit expression for the physical (non-vanishing) Hamiltonian. The scale factor and associated momentum cease to be dynamical variables, leaving the scalar field as the only physical degree of freedom. We investigate the resulting classical theory, showing how the dynamics of the scale factor can be recovered via an appropriate interpretation of the Hamiltonian as a volume. We then quantise the system in the Schr\\\"odinger picture. In the quantum theory we recover the dynamics of the scale factor by interpreting the spectrum and expectation value of the Hamiltonian as being associated with volume rather than energy. If trajectories in the sense of de~Broglie-Bohm are introduced in the quantum theory, these are found to match those of the classical theory. We suggest that these trajectories may provide the basis for a perturbation theory in which both background and perturbations are quantised. ",

In a recent couple of works of a collaboration involving one of us, we have revised the controversy with the aims of, on the one hand, clarifying some conceptual issues surrounding it, and, at the same time, arguing that collapse theories have the potential to offer a satisfactory resolution of the so-called paradox. Here we show an explicit calculation supporting this claim using a simplified model of black hole creation and evaporation, known as the CGHS model, together with a dynamical reduction theory, known as CSL, and some speculative, but seemingly natural ideas about the role of quantum gravity in connection with the would-be singularity.

An important motivation is that non-trivial topological objects such as microscopic wormholes may have been enlarged to macroscopic sizes in an expanding inflationary cosmological background. Since the Ricci scalar is only a function of time in standard cosmological models, we use this property as a simplifying assumption. More specifically, we consider a particular class of wormhole solutions corresponding to the choice of a spatially homogeneous Ricci scalar. The possibility of obtaining solutions with normal and exotic matter is explored and we find a variety of solutions including those in four dimensions that satisfy the null energy condition (NEC) in specific time intervals. In particular, for five dimensions, we find solutions that satisfy the NEC throughout the respective evolution. ",

This is the unavoidable starting point of the analysis; our main results will depend on the detailed understanding of these fundamentals.   In the second part of this series we study the stability of the radius function at the Cauchy horizon. In the third and final paper we show that, depending on the decay rate of the initial data, mass inflation may or may not occur; in fact, it is even possible to have (non-isometric) extensions of the spacetime across the Cauchy horizon as classical solutions of the Einstein equations.

These flows are unstable under ultra low real frequency perturbations because of the unbounded mode amplification near the sonic horizon. This results in a condensation of low frequency phonons which produces a spatially structured flow in the supersonic domain. Numerical simulations reveal that this zero-frequency undulation suppresses the instability when its spatial extension is infinite, and when its phase is near that of a \"shadow soliton\" solution attached to the sonic horizon. These phenomena are akin to the condensation of rotons in flowing superfluid helium-4 when exceeding the Landau velocity. They also pertain to shallow water waves propagating on transcritical flows.

We use a post-Newtonian expansion to construct an analytical spacetime and determine how the order of the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion affects the dynamics of the gas. We find very small differences in the late-time bulk dynamics of non-magnetized hydrodynamic evolutions between the two spacetimes down to separations of approximately $40GM/c^2$ where $M$ is the total mass of the binary. For smaller separations, the differences due to PN-order become comparable to differences caused by using initial data further from equilibrium. For magnetized gas, MHD stresses, which drives the accretion dynamics, tends to mask all higher order PN effects even at separations of $20GM/c^2$, leading to essentially the same observed electromagnetic luminosity. This implies that our calculations of the EM signal may be robust down to small binary separations. Our investigation is the first to demonstrate how the level of PN accuracy affects a circumbinary disk's evolution and informs us of the range in separation within which to trust the PN approximation for this kind of study. We also address the influence the initial conditions and binary separation have on simulation predictions. ",

By combining a 1+(1+2) decomposition, the canonical form of the spacetime metric and a suitable specification of the conformal structure of the foliating two-surfaces a gauge fixing is introduced. It is shown that, in terms of the chosen geometrically distinguished variables, the 1+3 Hamiltonian and momentum constraints can be recast into the form of a parabolic equation and a first order symmetric hyperbolic system, respectively. Initial data to this system can be given on one of the two-surfaces foliating the three-dimensional initial data surface. The 1+3 reduced Einstein's equations are also determined. By combining the 1+3 momentum constraint with the reduced system of the secondary 1+2 decomposition a mixed hyperbolic-hyperbolic system is formed. It is shown that solutions to this mixed hyperbolic-hyperbolic system are also solutions to the full set of Einstein's equations provided that the 1+3 Hamiltonian constraint is solved on the initial data surface $\\Sigma_0$ and the 1+2 Hamiltonian and momentum type expressions vanish on a world-tube yielded by the Lie transport of one of the two-surfaces foliating $\\Sigma_0$ along the time evolution vector field. Whenever the foliating two-surfaces are compact without boundary in the spacetime and a regular origin exists on the time-slices---this is the location where the foliating two-surfaces smoothly reduce to a point---it suffices to guarantee that the 1+3 Hamiltonian constraint holds on the initial data surface.

The parameter space of both the stable and unstable regime is derived and observational consequences are discussed: It is argued that the degravitating regime does not allow for a phenomenologically viable cosmology.

We compute unperturbed neutron star models adopting realistic equations of state for the neutron star's core and crust. For scalar-tensor theories that allow for spontaneous scalarization, the crust thickness can be significantly smaller than in general relativity. We derive the perturbation equation describing torsional oscillations in scalar-tensor theory, and we solve the corresponding eigenvalue problem to find the oscillation frequencies. The fundamental mode (overtone) frequencies become smaller (larger) than in general relativity for scalarized stellar models. Torsional oscillation frequencies may yield information on the crust microphysics if microphysics effects are not degenerate with strong-gravity effects, such as those due to scalarization. To address this issue, we consider two different models for the equation of state of the crust and we look at the effects of electron screening. The effect of scalarization on torsional oscillation frequencies turns out to be smaller than uncertainties in the microphysics for all spontaneous scalarization models allowed by binary pulsar observations. Our study shows that the observation of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) following giant flares can be used to constrain the microphysics of neutron star crusts, whether spontaneous scalarization occurs or not.

    "abstract": "  Understanding the role of higher derivatives is probably one of the most relevant questions in quantum gravity theory. Already at the semiclassical level, when gravity is a classical background for quantum matter fields, the action of gravity should include fourth derivative terms to provide renormalizability in the vacuum sector. The same situation holds in the quantum theory of metric. At the same time, including the fourth derivative terms means the presence of massive ghosts, which are gauge-independent massive states with negative kinetic energy. At both classical and quantum level such ghosts violate stability and hence the theory becomes inconsistent. Several approaches to solve this contradiction were invented and we are proposing one more, which looks simpler than those what were considered before. We explore the dynamics of the gravitational waves on the background of classical solutions and give certain arguments that massive ghosts produce instability only when they are present as physical particles. At least on the cosmological background one can observe that if the initial frequency of the metric perturbations is much smaller than the mass of the ghost, no instabilities are present. ",

In this formalism, alternative theories manifest themselves via corrections to the phase and frequency, as predicted by General Relativity (GR), at different post-Newtonian (PN) orders. In order to present a generic test of alternative theories of gravity, we assume that the coupling constant of each alternative theory is manifestly positive, allowing corrections to the GR waveforms to be either positive or negative. By exploring the capabilities of massive black hole binary GR waveforms in the detection and parameter estimation of corrected time domain ppE signals, using the current eLISA configuration (as presented for the ESA Cosmic Vision L3 mission), we demonstrate that for corrections arising at higher than 1PN order in phase and frequency, GR waveforms are sufficient for both detecting and estimating the parameters of alternative theory signals. However, for theories introducing corrections at the 0 and 0.5 PN order, GR waveforms are not capable of covering the entire parameter space, requiring the use of non-GR waveforms for detection and parameter estimation.

This shows that inflation is possible even when the energy density of the vacuum is large and negative.

Under general assumptions, we discover that the quantum space-time on which the field propagates can be replaced by a classical space-time, whose metric depends explicitly on the energy of the field: as shown by an analysis of dispersion relations, quanta of different energy propagate on different metrics, similar to photons in a refractive material (hence the name \"rainbow\" used in the literature). In deriving this result, we do not consider any specific theory of quantum gravity: the qualitative behavior of high-energy particles on quantum space-time relies only on the assumption that the quantum space-time is described by a wave-function $\\Psi_o$ in a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_G$.

    "abstract": "  We develop a definitive physical-space scattering theory for the scalar wave equation on Kerr exterior backgrounds in the general subextremal case |a|<M. In particular, we prove results corresponding to \"existence and uniqueness of scattering states\" and \"asymptotic completeness\" and we show moreover that the resulting \"scattering matrix\" mapping radiation fields on the past horizon and past null infinity to radiation fields on the future horizon and future null infinity is a bounded operator. The latter allows us to give a time-domain theory of superradiant reflection. The boundedness of the scattering matrix shows in particular that the maximal amplification of solutions associated to ingoing finite-energy wave packets on past null infinity is bounded. On the frequency side, this corresponds to the novel statement that the suitably normalised reflection and transmission coefficients are uniformly bounded independently of the frequency parameters. We further complement this with a demonstration that superradiant reflection indeed amplifies the energy radiated to future null infinity of suitable wave-packets as above. The results make essential use of a refinement of our recent proof [M. Dafermos, I. Rodnianski and Y. Shlapentokh-Rothman, Decay for solutions of the wave equation on Kerr exterior spacetimes III: the full subextremal case |a|<M, arXiv:1402.6034] of boundedness and decay for solutions of the Cauchy problem so as to apply in the class of solutions where only a degenerate energy is assumed finite. We show in contrast that the analogous scattering maps cannot be defined for the class of finite non-degenerate energy solutions. This is due to the fact that the celebrated horizon red-shift effect acts as a blue-shift instability when solving the wave equation backwards. ",

We also clarify the parameter space where the black hole solution exists. On the other hand, to examine the particle motion around such black hole, we derive the geodesic equation. The behavior of the effective potential for the radial particle motion is almost the same as that in general relativity, but the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit and the angular momentum giving the innermost stable circular orbit can be changed, depending on the coupling constant. In particular, we find that the radius of innermost stable circular orbit with the specific value of the coupling constant can be smaller than that for the extreme case in general relativity.

They are obviously relevant for very compact sources of the gravitational field, such as neutron stars or black holes. In this paper I discuss another, less obvious situation, in which large relativistic effects may arise due to a complicated, multiscale structure of the matter distribution. I present an exact solution with an inhomogeneous energy density distribution in the form of a hierarchy of nested voids and overdensities of various sizes, extending from the homogeneity scale down to arbitrary small scales. I show that although each of the voids and overdensities seems to be very weakly relativistic, and thus easy to describe using the linearized general relativity, the solution taken as a whole lies in fact in the nonlinear regime. Its nonlinear properties are most easily seen when we compare the ADM mass of the solution and the integral of the local mass density: the difference between them, i.e. the relativistic mass deficit, can be significant provided that the inhomogeneities extend to sufficiently small scales. The non-additivity of masses implies a large backreaction effect, i.e. significant discrepancy between the averaged, large-scale effective stress-energy tensor and the naive average of the local energy density. I show that this is a general relativistic effect arising due to the inhomogeneous, multiscale structure. I also discuss the relevance of the results in cosmology and relativistic astrophysics. ",

Unlike normal dielectrics, such a medium cannot change the speed of light, and its dynamics obey a Klein-Gordon equation. This work immediately suggests an extension of the standard theory, even if we require compliance with Lorentz invariance. Instead of a wave equation, the dynamics may satisfy a local algebraic relation involving the permittivity and the properties of the electromagnetic field, in analogy with more conventional dielectric (but still preserving Lorentz invariance). We develop the formalism for such theories and investigate some phenomenological implications. The problem of the divergence of the classical self-energy can be solved, or at least softened, in this framework. Some interesting new cosmological solutions for the very early universe are found, including the possibility of a bounce, inflation and expansion with a loitering phase, all of which are induced by early variations in alpha.

We start from the Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) cosmology of general relativity (GR) to establish a framework for the gravitational thermodynamics. The Cai-Kim Clausius equation $T_{\\text{A}}dS_{\\text{A}}=-dE_{\\text{A}}=-A_{\\text{A}} \\psi_t$ for the isochoric process of an instantaneous apparent horizon indicates that, the Universe and its horizon entropies encode the Positive Out thermodynamic sign convention, which encourage us to adjust the traditional positive-heat-in Gibbs equation into the positive-heat-out version $dE_m=-T_mdS_m-P_mdV$. It turns out that the standard and the generalized second laws (GSLs) of nondecreasing entropies are always respected by the event-horizon system as long as the expanding Universe is dominated by nonexotic matter $-1\\leq w_m\\leq 1$, while for the apparent-horizon simple open system the two second laws hold if $-1\\leq w_m<-1/3$; also, the artificial local equilibrium assumption is abandoned in the GSL. All constraints regarding entropy evolution are expressed by the equation of state parameters, which show that from a thermodynamic perspective the phantom dark energy is less favored than the cosmological constant and the quintessence. Finally, the whole framework is extended from GR and $\\Lambda$CDM to modified gravities with field equations $R_{\\mu\\nu}-Rg_{\\mu\\nu}/2=8\\pi G_{\\text{eff}} T_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\text{(eff)}}$. Furthermore, this paper also proposes a solution to the temperature confusion and argues that the Cai-Kim temperature is more suitable than Hayward-Kodama, and both temperatures are independent of the inner or outer trappedness of the cosmological apparent horizon.

The fact that modern equations of state are stiff, with an effective adiabatic index larger than about two, above the nuclear density range is the key to establishing the universality for neutron stars and quark stars with typical compactness from about 0.1 to 0.3. On the other hand, the I-Love-Q relations of low-mass neutron stars near the minimum mass limit depend more sensitively on the underlying equation of state because these stars are composed mainly of softer matter at low densities. However, the I-Love-Q relations for low-mass quark stars can still be represented accurately by the incompressible limit. We also study the I-Love relation connecting the moment of inertia and tidal deformability analytically in Newtonian gravity and show why the I-Love-Q relation is weakly dependent on the underlying equation of state and can be attributed to its incompressible limit.

    "abstract": "  We perform a thorough study of greybody factors for minimally-coupled scalar fields propagating on the background of rotating black holes in higher (odd) dimensions with all angular momenta set equal. For this special case, the solution enjoys an enhanced symmetry, which translates into the advantageous feature of being cohomogeneity-1, i.e., these backgrounds depend on a single radial coordinate. Our analysis contemplates three distinct situations, with the cosmological constant being zero, positive or negative. Using the technique of matched asymptotic expansions we compute analytically the greybody factors in the low-frequency regime, restricting to s-wave scattering. Our formulas generalize those obtained previously in the literature for the static and spherically symmetric case, with corrections arising from the change in the horizon area due to rotation. It is also proven that, for this family of black holes, the horizon area is a decreasing function of the spin parameter, without regard of dimensionality and of cosmological constant. Through an improvement on a calculation specific to the class of small black holes in anti-de Sitter and not restricted to the usual low-frequency regime, we uncover a rich structure of the greybody spectrum, more complex than previously reported but also enjoying a certain degree of universality. We complement our low-frequency analytic results with numerical computations valid over a wide range of frequencies and extend them to higher angular momentum quantum numbers, $\\ell>0$. This allows us to probe the superradiant regime that is observed for corotating wavefunctions. We point out that the maximum amplification factor for intermediate-size black holes in anti-de Sitter can be surprisingly large. ",

    "abstract": "  A conformal coupling of the metric in the Jordan frame to the energy-momentum tensor, screens the scalar field gravitational coupling strength $G$ in modified gravity (MOG). The scalar field acquires a mass which depends on the local matter density: the scalar field particle is massive for the Sun and earth, where the density is high compared to low density environments in cosmology and astrophysics. Together with the screening of the vector field $\\phi_\\mu$, this guarantees that solar system tests of gravity are satisfied. The conformal metric is coupled to the electromagnetic matter field and energy-momentum tensor, screening $G$ for the Sun and the deflection of light by the Sun and the Shapiro time delay in MOG are in agreement with general relativity. For galaxies and galactic clusters the enhanced gravitational coupling constant $G$ leads to agreement with gravitational lensing without dark matter. For compact binary pulsars the screening of $G$ removes the monopole and dipole gravitational radiation modes in agreement with the binary pulsar timing data. ",

    "abstract": "  The emergence of the seeds of cosmic structure, from a perfect isotropic and homogeneous Universe, has not been clearly explained by the standard version of inflationary models as the dynamics involved preserve the homogeneity and isotropy at all times. A proposal that attempts to deal with this problem, by introducing \"the self-induced collapse hypothesis,\" has been introduced by D. Sudarsky and collaborators in previous papers. In all these works, the collapse of the wave function of the inflaton mode is restricted to occur during the inflationary period. In this paper, we analyse the possibility that the collapse happens during the radiation era. A viable model can be constructed under the condition that the inflaton field variable must be affected by the collapse while the momentum variable can or cannot be affected. Another condition to be fulfilled is that the time of collapse must be independent of $k$. However, when comparing with recent observational data, the predictions of the model cannot be distinguished from the ones provided by the standard inflationary scenario. The main reason for this arises from the requirement that primordial power spectrum obtained for the radiation era matches the amplitude of scalar fluctuations consistent with the latest CMB observations. This latter constraint results in a limit on the possible times of collapse and ensures that the contribution of the inflaton field to the energy-momentum tensor is negligible compared to the contribution of the radiation fields.

    "abstract": "  We perform numerical evolutions of cosmological scenarios using a standard general relativistic code in spherical symmetry. We concentrate on two different situations: initial matter distributions that are homogeneous and isotropic, and perturbations to those that respect the spherical symmetry. As matter models we consider the case of a pressureless perfect fluid, i.e. dust, and the case of a real massive scalar field oscillating around the minimum of the potential. Both types of matter have been considered as possible dark matter candidates in the cosmology literature, dust being closely related to the standard cold dark matter paradigm. We confirm that in the linear regime the perturbations associated with these types of matter grow in essentially the same way, the main difference being that in the case of a scalar field the dynamics introduce a cut-off in the power spectrum of the density perturbations at scales comparable with the Compton wavelength of the field. We also follow the evolutions well beyond the linear regime showing that both models are able to form structure. In particular we find that, once in the nonlinear regime, perturbations collapse faster in a universe dominated by dust. This is expected to delay the formation of the first structures in the scalar field dark matter scenario with respect to the standard cold dark matter one. ",

This article presents an example from loop quantum gravity in which the singularity problem is solved in such a way that the information-loss problem is made worse. Quantum effects in this scenario, in contrast to previous non-singular models, do not eliminate the event horizon and introduce a new Cauchy horizon where determinism breaks down. Although infinities are avoided, for all practical purposes the core of the black hole plays the role of a naked singularity. Recent developments in loop quantum gravity indicate that this aggravated information loss problem is likely to be the generic outcome, putting strong conceptual pressure on the theory. ",

In our opinion these constraints are unphysical. We prove that no homogeneous stars with non-constant Ricci scalar can be matched smoothly with a static exterior for any nonlinear function f(R). Therefore, these extra constraints make classes of physically realistic collapse scenarios in general relativity, non-admissible in these theories. We also find an exact solution for an inhomogeneous collapsing star in the Starobinski model that obeys all the energy and matching conditions.

The results of our numerical analysis for a collisional matter $f(R)$ theory are compared with those resulting from pressure-less matter $f(R)$ theory and from the $\\mathrm{\\Lambda}\\mathrm{CDM}$ model.

    "abstract": "  Binary neutron stars in circular orbits can be modeled as helically symmetric, i.e., stationary in a rotating frame. This symmetry gives rise to a first integral of the Euler equation, often employed for constructing equilibrium solutions via iteration. For eccentric orbits, however, the lack of helical symmetry has prevented the use of this method, and the numerical relativity community has often resorted to constructing initial data by superimposing boosted spherical stars without solving the Euler equation. The spuriously excited neutron star oscillations seen in evolutions of such data arise because such configurations lack the appropriate tidal deformations and are stationary in a linearly comoving---rather than rotating---frame. We consider eccentric configurations at apoapsis that are instantaneously stationary in a rotating frame. We extend the notion of helical symmetry to eccentric orbits, by approximating the elliptical orbit of each companion as instantaneously circular, using the ellipse's inscribed circle. The two inscribed helical symmetry vectors give rise to approximate instantaneous first integrals of the Euler equation throughout each companion. We use these integrals as the basis of a self-consistent iteration of the Einstein constraints to construct conformal thin-sandwich initial data for eccentric binaries. We find that the spurious stellar oscillations are reduced by at least an order of magnitude, compared with those found in evolutions of superposed initial data. The tidally induced oscillations, however, are physical and qualitatively similar to earlier evolutions. Finally, we show how to incorporate radial velocity due to radiation reaction in our inscribed helical symmetry vectors, which would allow one to obtain truly non-eccentric initial data when our eccentricity parameter $e$ is set to zero.

An in-depth investigation in the Newtonian limit is further carried out to pinpoint its underlying physical mechanism and hence leads to a unified $f$-$I$-Love relation. We reach the conclusion that these EOS-insensitive formulas stem from a common physical origin --- compact stars can be considered as quasiincompressible when they react to slow time variations introduced by $f$-mode oscillations, tidal forces and rotations.

A reduced set of frame independent master variables are determined, which obey two closed wave equations - one for the transverse, trace-free (tensor) perturbations and the other for the additional scalar degree of freedom which characterise fourth-order theories of gravity. We show that for the tensor modes, the underlying dynamics in f(R) gravity is governed by a modified Regge-Wheeler tensor which obeys the same Regge-Wheeler equation as in General Relativity. We find that the possible sources of scalar quasinormal modes that follow from scalar perturbations for the lower multipoles result from primordial black holes, while higher mass, stellar black holes are associated with extremely high multipoles, which can only be produced in the first stage of black hole formation.

Tidal coupling also distorts the binary's members, changing them (at lowest order) from spheres to ellipsoids. At least in the limit of fluid bodies and Newtonian gravity, there are simple connections between the geometry of the distorted ellipsoid and the impact of tides on the orbit's evolution. In this paper, we develop tools for investigating tidal distortions of rapidly rotating black holes using techniques that are good for strong-field, fast-motion binary orbits. We use black hole perturbation theory, so our results assume extreme mass ratios. We develop tools to compute the distortion to a black hole's curvature for any spin parameter, and for tidal fields arising from any bound orbit, in the frequency domain. We also develop tools to visualize the horizon's distortion for black hole spin $a/M \\le \\sqrt{3}/2$ (leaving the more complicated $a/M > \\sqrt{3}/2$ case to a future analysis). We then study how a Kerr black hole's event horizon is distorted by a small body in a circular, equatorial orbit.

The thermodynamics of these holes is characterized by heat capacities that may have both signs depending on the parameters of the theory. Leaving aside the normal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole, it is shown that only some phantom black holes of both classes exhibit critical phenomena. The two classes share a nonextremality, but special, critical point where the transition is continuous and the heat capacity, at constant charge, changes sign with an infinite discontinuity. This point yields a classification scheme for critical points. It is concluded that the two unstable and stable phases coexist on one side of the criticality state and disappear on the other side, that is, there is no configuration where only one phase exists. The sinh class has an extremality critical point where the entropy diverges. The transition from extremality to nonextremality with the charge held constant is accompanied by a loss of mass and an increase in the temperature. A special case of this transition is when the hole is isolated (microcanonical ensemble), it will evolve by emission of energy, which results in a decrease of its mass, to the final state of minimum mass and vanishing heat capacity. The Ehrenfest scheme of classification is inaccurate in this case but the generalized one due to Hilfer leads to conclude that the transition is of order less than unity.

In the article an interesting method, to analyze the bouncing FRW solutions in a spatially flat universe using f(R) gravity models using an effective Einstein frame description of the process, is presented. The analysis shows that a cosmological bounce in the f(R) theory need not be described by an equivalent bounce in the Einstein frame description of the process where actually there may be no bounce at all. Nevertheless the Einstein frame description of the bouncing phenomena turns out to be immensely important as the dynamics of the bounce becomes amenable to logic based on general relativistic intuition. The theory of scalar cosmological perturbations in the bouncing universe models in $f(R)$ theories has also been worked out in the Einstein frame. ",

After describing the conformal method's construction of constant mean curvature (CMC) slices of Kasner spacetimes, we turn our attention to non-CMC slices of the smaller family of flat Kasner spacetimes. In this restricted setting we obtain a full description of the construction of certain $U^{n-1}$ symmetric slices, even in the far-from-CMC regime. Among the conformal data sets generating these slices we find that most data sets construct a single flat Kasner spacetime, but that there are also far-from-CMC data sets that construct one-parameter families of slices. Although these non-CMC families are analogues of well-known CMC one-parameter families, they differ in important ways. Most significantly, unlike the CMC case, the condition signaling the appearance of these non-CMC families is not naturally detected from the conformal data set itself. In light of this difficulty, we propose modifications of the conformal method that involve a conformally transforming mean curvature. ",

In detail, we will see that non-minimal coupling allows to renormalize the Dirac equation even when torsion is taken into consideration and that in some type of non-minimally coupled models parity-oddness might be present even in the gravitational sector. In addition, we will show that in the presence of the considered non-minimal coupling, torsion is able to evade cosmological singularities as it can happen in the minimal coupling case and in some other non--minimally coupled theory. In the course of the paper, we shall consider a specific interaction as prototype to study this fermionic non-minimal coupling, but we will try to present results that do not depend on the actual structure of the non-minimal couplings by investigating alternative types of interaction.

Fortunately, for sufficiently large asymptotically flat Reissner-Nordstrom black holes, the evaporation process can be modeled via a system of coupled linear ordinary differential equations, with charge loss rate governed by Schwinger pair-production process. The same model can be generalized to study the evaporation of AdS Reissner-Nordstrom black holes with flat horizon. It was recently found that such black holes always evolve towards extremality since charge loss is inefficient. This property is completely opposite to the asymptotically flat case in which the black hole eventually loses its charges and tends towards Schwarzschild limit.

Recent proposals postulate the existence of a \"firewall\" at the event horizon that may incinerate an infalling observer.

We apply a method new to gravitational wave data analysis --- Bayesian non-parameterics --- to the problem of gravitational wave detection, with an emphasis on pulsar timing array observations. In Bayesian non-parametrics, constraints are set on the function space that may be reasonably thought to characterize the range of gravitational-wave signals. This differs from the approaches currently employed or proposed, which focus on introducing parametric signal models or looking for excess power as evidence of the presence of a gravitational wave signal. Our Bayesian nonparametrics analysis method addresses two issues: (1) investigate if a gravitational wave burst is present in the data; (2) infer the sky location of the source and the duration of the burst. Compared with the popular method proposed by Finn \\& Lommen, our method improves in two aspects: (1) we can estimate the burst duration by adding the prior that the gravitational wave signals are smooth, while Finn \\& Lommen ignored this important point; (2) we perform a full Bayesian analysis by marginalizing over all possible parameters and provide robust inference on the presence of gravitational waves, while Finn \\& Lommen chose to optimize over parameters, which would increase false alarm risk and also underestimate the parameter uncertainties.

The property has been studied in limited dimensions and the generalization in arbitrary dimensions is not straight-forward. In this Letter, we prove a useful formula, which makes it possible to investigate this conjectured universality in arbitrary dimensions for the maximally symmetric black holes in general Lovelock gravity and $f(R)$ gravity.

We covariantly prove some important geometrical results for the apparent horizon, and state the necessary and sufficient conditions for a singularity to be locally naked. These conditions bring out, for the first time in a quantitative and transparent manner, the importance of the Weyl curvature in deforming and delaying the trapped region during continual gravitational collapse, making the central singularity locally visible.

Our attention is restricted to the case in which the two possible angular momenta of the geometry are set equal. In this situation the background is cohomogeneity-1, which amounts to a crucial technical simplification. It is found that the linearized Einstein equations are consistent only when the test shell is corotating with the spacetime. However, it is argued that this is a consequence of the matter on the shell being described by dust or, more precisely, noninteracting test particles. We compute the mass and angular momenta of the perturbed spacetime using a counterterm subtraction method, for which we provide an explicit formula that has not appeared previously in the literature. The results are in agreement with the expected expressions for energy and angular momenta of geodesic particles in AdS$_5$. ",

We consider the two most importantcases: dust and radiation. A complete numerical integration of the Einstein field equations coupled with the diffusion equations is done to demonstrate how the presence of diffusion can affect the dynamics of cosmological evolution, where the most attention is paid to changes to the late-time behaviour. We show that aside from quantitative effects, diffusion can result in significant qualitative differences. For example, the cosmologies may recollapse if diffusion is sufficiently strong, or evolve towards the de Sitter state otherwise. In constrast to the diffusionless case, radiation isotropizes in presence of diffusion, and the tilt decreases exponentially at later times: $V\\sim e^{-0.25\\tau}$; also, we determine the decay rates of energy density, which become slower when the diffusion term is non-zero.

We derive elegant closed form solutions for relativistic observables such as the deflection angle and frame dragging effect that a light ray experiences in the gravitational fields (i) of a Kerr-Newman black hole and (ii) of a Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black hole. We then solve the more involved problem of treating a Kerr-Newman black hole as a gravitational lens, i.e. a KN black hole along with a static source of light and a static observer both located far away but otherwise at arbitrary positions in space. For this model, we derive the analytic solutions of the lens equations in terms of Appell and Lauricella hypergeometric functions and the Weierstra\\ss modular form. The exact solutions derived for null, spherical polar and non-polar orbits, are applied for the calculation of frame dragging for the orbit of a photon around the galactic centre, assuming that the latter is a Kerr-Newman black hole. We also apply the exact solution for the deflection angle of an equatorial light ray in the gravitational field of a Kerr-Newman black hole for the calculation of bending of light from the gravitational field of the galactic centre for various values of the Kerr parameter, electric charge and impact factor. In addition, we derive analytic expressions for the Maxwell tensor components for a Zero-Angular-Momentum-Observer (ZAMO) in the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter spacetime. ",

    "abstract": "  The Virgo detector is a kilometer-scale interferometer for gravitational wave detection located near Pisa (Italy). About 13 months of data were accumulated during four science runs (VSR1, VSR2, VSR3 and VSR4) between May 2007 and September 2011, with increasing sensitivity.   In this paper, the method used to reconstruct, in the range 10 Hz-10 kHz, the gravitational wave strain time series $h(t)$ from the detector signals is described. The standard consistency checks of the reconstruction are discussed and used to estimate the systematic uncertainties of the $h(t)$ signal as a function of frequency. Finally, an independent setup, the photon calibrator, is described and used to validate the reconstructed $h(t)$ signal and the associated uncertainties.   The uncertainties of the $h(t)$ time series are estimated to be 8% in amplitude. The uncertainty of the phase of $h(t)$ is 50 mrad at 10 Hz with a frequency dependence following a delay of 8 $\\mu$s at high frequency. A bias lower than $4\\,\\mathrm{\\mu s}$ and depending on the sky direction of the GW is also present. ",

This scenario is the F(R) extension of usual mimetic gravity classes, which are based on re-parametrizations of the metric using new, but not propagating, degrees of freedom, that can lead to a wider family of solutions. Performing a detailed dynamical analysis for exponential, power-law, and arbitrary F(R) forms, we extracted the corresponding critical points. Interestingly enough, we found that although the new features of mimetic F(R) gravity can affect the universe evolution at early and intermediate times, at late times they will not have any effect, and the universe will result at stable states that coincide with those of usual F(R) gravity. However, this feature holds for the late-time background evolution only. On the contrary, the behavior of the perturbations is expected to be different since the new term contributes to the perturbations even if it does not contribute at the background level. ",

By comparing the PN results for the energy flux with high precision numerical results in black hole perturbation theory, we find the region of validity in the PN approximation becomes larger with increasing PN orders. If one requires the relative error of the energy flux in the PN approximation to be less than $10^{-5}$, the energy flux at 11PN (4PN) can be used for $v\\lessapprox 0.33$ ($v\\lessapprox 0.13$). The region of validity can be further extended to $v\\lessapprox 0.4$ if one applies a resummation method to the energy flux at 11PN. We then compare the orbital phase during two-year inspiral from the PN results with the high precision numerical results. We find that for late (early) inspirals when $q\\le 0.3$ ($q\\le 0.9$), where $q$ is the dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole, the difference in the phase is less than 1 ($10^{-4}$) rads and hence these inspirals may be detected in the data analysis for space detectors such as eLISA/NGO by the PN templates. We also compute the energy flux radiated into the event horizon for a particle in circular orbits around a non-rotating black hole at 22.5PN, i.e. $v^{45}$ beyond the leading Newtonian approximation, which is comparable to the PN order derived in our previous work for the energy flux to infinity at 22PN.

In the first case, we show that the absence of gravity reveals itself as an incapability in the selection of a preferred parallelization at a local level, due to the fact that the infinitesimal local Lorentz subgroup acts as a symmetry group of the frame characterizing Minkowski spacetime. Finite transformations are also discussed in these examples and, contrary to the common lore on the subject, we conclude that the set of tetrads responsible for the parallelization of these manifolds is quite vast and that the remnant group of local Lorentz transformations includes one and two dimensional Abelian subgroups of the Lorentz group.

The matter distribution is considered to be anisotropic for which modified field equations are formed in context of $f(R)$ gravity. In order to achieve the collapse equation, we make use of the dynamical equations, extracted from linearly perturbed contracted Bianchi identities. The collapse equation carries adiabatic index $\\Gamma$ in terms of usual and dark source components, defining the range of stability/insatbility in Newtonian (N) and post-Newtonian (pN) eras. It is found that supersymmetric supergravity $f(R)$ model represents the more practical substitute of higher order curvature corrections. ",

    "abstract": "  We investigate the anti-de Sitter (AdS) counterpart to the well studied de Sitter (dS) model for energy-momentum space, viz \"$\\kappa$-momentum space\" space (with a structure based on the properties of the $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e Hopf algebra). On the basis of previous preliminary results one might expect the two models to be \"dual\": dS exhibiting an invariant maximal spatial momentum but unbounded energy, AdS a maximal energy but unbounded momentum. If that were the case AdS momentum space could be used to implement a principle of maximal Planck-scale energy, just as several studies use dS momentum space to postulate of maximal Planck-scale spatial momentum. However several unexpected features are uncovered in this paper, which limit the scope of the expected duality, and interestingly they take different forms in different coordinatizations of AdS momentum space. \"Cosmological\" AdS coordinates mimic the dS construction used for $\\kappa$-momentum space, and produce a Carrol limit in the ultraviolet. However, unlike the $\\kappa$-momentum space, the boundary of the covered patch breaks Lorentz invariance, thereby introducing a preferred frame. In \"horospherical\" coordinates we achieve full consistency with frame independence as far as boost transformations are concerned, but find that rotational symmetry is broken, leading to an anisotropic model for the speed of light. Finally, in \"static\" coordinates we find a way of deforming relativistic transformations that successfully enforces frame invariance and isotropy, and produces a Carrol limit in the ultraviolet. However, the phenomenological implications appear to be too weak for any realistic chance of detection. Our results are also relevant for a long-standing debate on whether or not coordinate redefinitions in momentum space lead to physically equivalent theories: our three proposals are evidently physically inequivalent (abridged) ",

Predicting the gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes requires numerical-relativity simulations, but these simulations are especially challenging when one or both holes have mass $m$ and spin $S$ exceeding the Bowen-York limit of $S/m^2=0.93$. We present improved methods that enable us to simulate merging, nearly extremal black holes more robustly and more efficiently. We use these methods to simulate an unequal-mass, precessing binary black hole coalescence, where the larger black hole has $S/m^2=0.99$. We also use these methods to simulate a non-precessing binary black hole coalescence, where both black holes have $S/m^2=0.994$, nearly reaching the Novikov-Thorne upper bound for holes spun up by thin accretion disks. We demonstrate numerical convergence and estimate the numerical errors of the waveforms; we compare numerical waveforms from our simulations with post-Newtonian and effective-one-body waveforms; we compare the evolution of the black-hole masses and spins with analytic predictions; and we explore the effect of increasing spin magnitude on the orbital dynamics (the so-called \"orbital hangup\" effect).

The process is different from that in the vicinity of a near-extremal black hole, since here there is no event horizon. This is the first example of particle collision with high center-of-mass energy in a spacetime with no event horizon, no naked singularity, and not being extremal in a clear sense.

    "abstract": "  Relationalism -- along the lines developed by Barbour and collaborators in the past 3 decades -- can be considered an advance with 1/4 of the facets of the canonical approach's Problem of Time as identified by Isham and Kuchar. Indeed, almost all of the Problem of Time facets have classical counterparts, since they arise from consequences of demanding background independence rather than about combining GR and QM per se. Moreover the quantum version is harder, while the classical counterpart provides some suggestions through being more solvable. The suggestion then is to consider the effect of this advance on the Problem of Time as a whole, as opposed to repeating the same classical portion for a different redundancy group acting on the configuration space: shape dynamics. There are indeed some knock-on effects because the facets are notoriously not independent. The other facets do also however require distinct insights. Finally, I comment on the above being `metric' background independence, whereas quantum gravity usually assumes many other levels of background structures. Whilst Isham already wrote about this over two decades ago, it has largely not yet been incorporated into quantum gravity programs, and could well be a good area to extend and re-envigour by use of relational thinking.

    "abstract": "  After reviewing the construction of metric from premetric electrodynamics with empirical improvement of accuracy in the skewonless case, we explore the role of skewons in the construction of spacetime metric in the full premetric electrodynamics. For metric principal part plus skewon part, we have shown that the Type I skewon part is constrained to < a few x 10^(-35) in the weak field/weak EEP violation limit. Type II skewon part is not constrained in the first order. However, in the second order it induces birefringence; the nonbirefringence observations constrain the Type II skewon part to 10^(-19). Nevertheless, an additional nonmetric induced second-order contribution to the principal part constitutive tensor compensates the Type II skewon birefringence and makes it nonbirefringent. This second-order contribution is just the extra piece to the core-metric principal constitutive tensor induced by the antisymmetric tensor. From the Tamm-Rubilar tensor density and the dispersion relation for the spacetime medium with the asymmetric-metric-induced constitutive tensor, we know that it is nonbirefringent. The antisymmetric metric induced constitutive tensor has a pseudoscalar part in the decomposition. The variation of his part is constrained by observation on cosmic polarization rotation to < 0.03, and gives one constraint on the 6-degree-of-freedom antisymmetric metric. Further studies of these 6 degrees of freedom experimental and theoretically are desired. ",

If there are super-compact objects which possess unstable circular orbits of photons, however, it may be difficult to distinguish them from black holes by observing photons. As a model of super-compact objects, we consider a gravastar (gravitational-vacuum-star) which was originally proposed by Mazur and Mottola. For definiteness, we adopt a spherical thin-shell model of a gravastar developed by Visser and Wiltshire, which connects interior de-Sitter geometry and exterior Schwarzschild geometry. We find that unstable circular orbits of photons can appear around the gravastar. Then, we investigate the optical images of the gravastar possessing unstable circular orbits, with assuming the optically transparent surface of it and two types of optical sources behind the gravastar: (i) an infinite optical plane and (ii) a companion star. The main feature of the image of (i) is that a bright disk and a dark thick ring surrounding the disk appear in the center of the region which would be completely dark if the compact object was not the gravastar but Schwarzschild black hole. Also in the case (ii), a small disk and arcs around the disk appear in the region which would be completely dark for the lensing image by Schwarzschild black hole. Because characteristic images appear inside the gravastar in both cases, we could tell the difference between a black hole and a gravastar with high-resolution VLBI observations near future. ",

The motion is geodesic in the former case, whereas in the case of an electromagnetic pulse it is accelerated by the radiation field filling the associated spacetime region. The interaction with the radiation field is modeled by a force term entering the equations of motion proportional to the 4-momentum density of radiation observed in the particle's rest frame. The corresponding classical scattering cross sections are evaluated too. ",

The resulting equation of state (EOS) of the matter distribution has been obtained. Physical analysis shows that the relativistic stellar structure for matter distribution obtained in this work may reasonably model an electrically charged compact star whose energy density associated with the electric fields is on the same order of magnitude as the energy density of fluid matter itself (e.g. electrically charged bare strange stars). These models permit a simple method of systematically fixing bounds on the maximum possible mass of cold compact electrically charged self-bound stars. It has been demonstrated numerically that the maximum compactness and mass increase in the presence of electric field and anisotropic pressures. Based on the analytic model developed in this present work, the values of the relevant physical quantities have been calculated by assuming the estimated masses and radii of some well known potential strange star candidates like PSR J1614-2230, PSR J1903+327, Vela X-1, and 4U 1820-30.

In the present paper we complete this analysis by numerically constructing and discussing the lines of force of the \"effective\" electric field of the sole particle with the subtraction of the dominant contribution of the black hole. We also give the total field due to the black hole and the particle. As the black hole becomes extreme an effect analogous to the Meissner effect arises for the electric field, with the \"effective field\" lines of the point charge being expelled by the outer horizon of the black hole. This effect existing at the level of test field approximation, i.e. by neglecting the backreaction on the background metric and electromagnetic field due to the particle's mass and charge, is here found also at the complete perturbative level. We point out analogies with similar considerations for magnetic fields by Bi{\\v c}\\'ak and Dvo{\\v r}\\'ak. We also explicitly show that the linearization of the recently obtained Belinski-Alekseev exact solution coincides with our solution in the Regge-Wheeler gauge.

    "abstract": "  The second generation of gravitational-wave detectors is scheduled to start operations in 2015. Gravitational-wave signatures of compact binary coalescences could be used to accurately test the strong-field dynamical predictions of general relativity. Computationally expensive data analysis pipelines, including TIGER, have been developed to carry out such tests. As a means to cheaply assess whether a particular deviation from general relativity can be detected, Cornish et al. and Vallisneri recently proposed an approximate scheme to compute the Bayes factor between a general-relativity gravitational-wave model and a model representing a class of alternative theories of gravity parametrised by one additional parameter. This approximate scheme is based on only two easy-to-compute quantities: the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal and the fitting factor between the signal and the manifold of possible waveforms within general relativity. In this work, we compare the prediction from the approximate formula against an exact numerical calculation of the Bayes factor using the lalinference library. We find that, using frequency-domain waveforms, the approximate scheme predicts exact results with good accuracy, providing the correct scaling with the signal-to-noise ratio at a fitting factor value of 0.992 and the correct scaling with the fitting factor at a signal-to-noise ratio of 20, down to a fitting factor of $\\sim$ 0.9. We extend the framework for the approximate calculation of the Bayes factor which significantly increases its range of validity, at least to fitting factors of $\\sim$ 0.7 or higher. ",

    "abstract": "  A network of large-scale laser interferometers is currently employed for searches of gravitational waves from various astrophysical sources. The frequency dependence of the dynamic response of these detectors introduces corrections to their antenna patterns which in principle can affect the outcome of the associated data-analysis algorithms. The magnitude of these corrections and the corresponding systematic errors have recently been estimated for searches of periodic and stochastic gravitational waves (CQG 25 (2008) 184017). However, the calculation of the detector response in that paper followed the traditional semi-rigorous approach which does not properly take into account the curved nature of spacetime. The question then arises as to whether the results will be the same if the calculation is done within the rigorous framework of general relativity. In this paper we provide such a derivation of the response of the detectors to gravitational waves. We obtain the photon propagation time from the solution of the equation for null geodesics and calculate the corresponding phase delay by solving the eikonal equation for curved spacetime. The calculations are then extended to include phase amplification from multi-beam interference in Fabry-Perot resonators which play an important role in the formation of the signal in these detectors.

The action depends on the gravitational and matter Lagrangian. The gravitational Lagrangian depends on the metric tensor and its first and second derivatives. The matter Lagrangian includes dark matter, dark energy and the ordinary baryonic matter. The total Lagrangian is expanded in an asymptotic Taylor series around the background manifold defined as a solution of Einstein's equations in the form of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric tensor. The small parameter of the decomposition is the magnitude of the metric tensor perturbation. Each term of the series expansion is gauge-invariant and all of them together form a basis for the successive post-Friedmannian approximations. The approximation scheme is covariant and the asymptotic nature of the Lagrangian decomposition does not require the post-Friedmannian perturbations to be small though computationally it works the most effectively when the perturbed metric is close enough to the background FLRW metric. The temporal evolution of the background metric is governed by dark matter and dark energy and we associate the large scale inhomogeneities in these two components as those generated by the primordial cosmological perturbations. The small scale inhomogeneities are generated by the condensations of baryonic matter considered as the bare perturbations. We explicitly work out the covariant field equations of the successive post-Friedmannian approximations of Einstein's equations and derive equations of motion of large and small scale inhomogeneities of dark matter and dark energy. We apply these equations to derive the post-Friedmannian equations of motion of the baryonic matter. ",

In order to explore this conjecture (and the meaning of compatibility), we develop suitable tools for determining the relation between quantum theories based on different time functions. First, we discuss how a time function fixes a canonical structure on the constraint surface. The presentation includes both the kinematical and the reduced perspective, and the relation between them. Second, we formulate twin theorems about the existence of two inequivalent maps between any two deparameterizations, a {\\it formal canonical} and a {\\it coordinate} one. They are used to separate the effect of choice of clock from other effects. We show, in an example, how the spectra of quantum observables are transformed under the change of clock and prove, via a general argument, the existence of choice-of-time-induced semiclassical effects. Finally, we study an example, in which we find that the semiclassical discrepancies can in fact be arbitrarily large for dynamical observables. We conclude that the values of critical energy density or critical volume in the bouncing scenarios of quantum cosmology cannot in general be at the Planck scale and always need to be given with reference to a specific time function.

What makes a spin foam model also an energetic causal set is Wieland's identification of new momenta, conserved at events (or four-simplices), whose norms are not mass, but the volume of tetrahedra. This realizes the torsion constraints, which are missing in previous spin foam models, and are needed to relate the connection dynamics to those of the metric, as in general relativity.

    "abstract": "  The Cosmic Blackbody Background Radiation pervades the entire Universe, and so falls into every astrophysical black hole. The blueshift of the infalling photons, measured by a static observer, is infinite at the event horizon. This raises a question as to whether a \"firewall\" of high energy density may form just outside the horizon, or whether the effect can be attributed exclusively to a singular behavior of the static observer's frame at the horizon. In principle, the presence of such firewall may alter the motion of the infalling matter, influence the black hole evolution, or even invalidate the {\\it vacuum} Einstein field equation solution as a realistic approximation for black holes. In this paper we show by means of analytic calculations that all these effects indeed exist, but their magnitude is typically negligibly small, even though the matter stress tensor is divergent in the static frame at $r=2M$. That is not surprising because of the divergent relation of that frame to a freely falling frame as $r \\rightarrow 2M$; however it represents a kind of classical analogue for the Black Hole Complementarity principle that has been proposed for quantum effects near a black hole. What is perhaps more surprising is the divergence of the radiation stress tensor for massive particles moving on circular geodesic orbits for values of $r$ approaching $r = 3M$.

    "abstract": "  The gravitational self-force has thus far been formulated in background spacetimes for which the metric is a solution to the Einstein field equations in vacuum. While this formulation is sufficient to describe the motion of a small object around a black hole, other applications require a more general formulation that allows for a nonvacuum background spacetime. We provide a foundation for such extensions, and carry out a concrete formulation of the gravitational self-force in two specific cases. In the first we consider a particle of mass $m$ and scalar charge $q$ moving in a background spacetime that contains a background scalar field. In the second we consider a particle of mass $m$ and electric charge $e$ moving in an electrovac spacetime. The self-force incorporates all couplings between the gravitational perturbations and those of the scalar or electromagnetic fields. It is expressed as a sum of local terms involving tensors defined in the background spacetime and evaluated at the current position of the particle, as well as tail integrals that depend on the past history of the particle. Because such an expression is rarely a useful starting point for an explicit evaluation of the self-force, we also provide covariant expressions for the singular potentials, expressed as local expansions near the world line; these can be involved in the construction of effective extended sources for the regular potentials, or in the computation of regularization parameters when the self-force is computed as a sum over spherical-harmonic modes.

    "abstract": "  The Einstein Telescope (ET), a proposed third-generation gravitational wave observatory, would enable tests of the no-hair theorem by looking at the characteristic frequencies and damping times of black hole ringdown signals.

Given that such sources may be relatively rare, it is of interest to see how well the no-hair theorem can be tested with events at much larger distances and with smaller signal-to-noise ratios, thus accessing a far bigger volume of space and a larger number of sources. We employ a model selection scheme called TIGER (Test Infrastructure for GEneral Relativity), which was originally developed to test general relativity with weak binary coalescence signals that will be seen in second-generation detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. TIGER is well-suited for the regime of low signal-to-noise ratio, and information from a population of sources can be combined so as to arrive at a stronger test. By performing a range of simulations using the expected noise power spectral density of Einstein Telescope, we show that with TIGER, similar deviations from the no-hair theorem as considered in previous work will be detectable with great confidence using $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ sources distributed uniformly in co-moving volume out to 50 Gpc ($z \\lesssim 5$).

    "abstract": "  The search for gravitational waves is one of today's major scientific endeavors. A gravitational wave can interact with matter by exciting vibrations of elastic bodies. Earth itself is a large elastic body whose so-called normal-mode oscillations ring up when a gravitational wave passes. Therefore, precise measurement of vibration amplitudes can be used to search for the elusive gravitational-wave signals. Earth's free oscillations that can be observed after high-magnitude earthquakes have been studied extensively with gravimeters and low-frequency seismometers over many decades leading to invaluable insight into Earth's structure. Making use of our detailed understanding of Earth's normal modes, numerical models are employed for the first time to accurately calculate Earth's gravitational-wave response, and thereby turn a network of sensors that so far has served to improve our understanding of Earth, into an astrophysical observatory exploring our Universe. In this article, we constrain the energy density of gravitational waves to values in the range 0.035 - 0.15 normalized by the critical energy density of the Universe at frequencies between 0.3mHz and 5mHz, using 10 years of data from the gravimeter network of the Global Geodynamics Project that continuously monitors Earth's oscillations. This work is the first step towards a systematic investigation of the sensitivity of gravimeter networks to gravitational waves. Further advance in gravimeter technology could improve sensitivity of these networks and possibly lead to gravitational-wave detection. ",

It is shown that regardless whether the primary space is Riemannian or Lorentzian whenever the foliating hypersurfaces are Riemannian the `Hamiltonian' and `momentum' type expressions are subject to a subsidiary first order symmetric hyperbolic system. Since this subsidiary system is linear and homogeneous in the `Hamiltonian' and `momentum' type expressions the hyperbolicity of the system implies that in both cases the solutions to the `reduced' set of field equations are also solutions to the full set of equations provided that the constraints hold on one of the hypersurfaces foliating the base manifold.

For the Moncrief-Ryan (or `wormhole') Hamilton-Jacobi solution, we compute the ground state quantum correction term associated with operator ordering ambiguities and show how higher order correction terms can be computed. We also determine the explicit, leading order forms of a family of excited states and show how to compute their quantum corrections as smooth, globally defined functions on the Bianchi IX minisuperspace. These excited-state solutions are peaked away from the minisuperspace origin and are labeled by a pair of positive integers that can be plausibly interpreted as graviton excitation numbers for the two independent anisotropy degrees of freedom. The modified semi-classical method used here is applicable to more general models, representing a significant progress in the Wheeler-DeWitt approach to quantum gravity. ",

While analyzing the quasinormal modes, we find that the massive scalar quasinormal mode frequencies in the complex $\\omega$ plane shows a dramatic change when we plot it as a progressive function of quintessence state parameter.

Base on the generalized uncertainty principle, we investigate the influence of quantum gravity and the result tell us that the quantum gravity correction accelerates the evaporation of black hole. Using corrected Dirac equation in curved spacetime and Hamilton-Jacobi method, we address the tunnelling of fermions in a 4-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime.   After solving the equation of motion of the spin 1/2 field, we obtain the corrected Hawking temperature. It turns out that the correction depends not only on the mass of black hole but aslo on the mass of emitted fermions.

One approach for handling the problem is the moving puncture method, which has become an important tool in numerical relativity since it allows long term simulations of binary black holes.

We discuss how the results of the stationary Schwarzschild '1+log'-trumpet change when spin is added. This modification enables a simple and cheap algorithm for determining the spin of a non-moving black hole for this particular slicing condition.

The unique labeling of a c-causet $x$ enables us to define a natural metric $d(a,b)$ between comparable vertices $a,b$ of $x$. The metric is then employed to define geodesics and curvatures on $x$. We next consider the macroscopic picture which describes the growth process $x \\to y$ of c-causets. We propose that this process is governed by a quantum dynamics given by complex amplitudes. Denoting the set of c-causets by $\\pscript$ we show that the growth process $(\\pscript ,\\to)$ can be structured into a discrete 4-manifold. This 4-manifold presents a unified approach to a discrete quantum gravity for which we define discrete analogues of Einstein's field equations and Dirac's equation. ",

The galactic center serving as gravitational lens gives rise to 4 images: 2 images on the same side as the source and 2 images on the opposite side of the source from the optic axis. We compute positions and time delays of these images for many values of the angular source position. The time delays of primary images decrease with an increase in angular source position and are always negative. The time delays of the other 3 images are negative for small angular source position; however, they increase with an increase in angular source position. Such observations would support strongly naked singularity interpretation of the galactic center and, if ever observed, would disprove the cosmic censorship hypothesis proposed by Roger Penrose as well as a weaker version by Virbhadra that allows existence of weakly, but not marginally and strongly naked singularities.

The corresponding field-theoretical notions are the energy-momentum-stress tensor T and the spin angular momentum tensor S. Since each object in physics carries energy and, if fermionic, also spin, the notions of T and S can be spotted in all domains of physics. We discuss the T and S currents in Special Relativity (SR), in General Relativity (GR), and in the Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity (EC). We collect our results in 4 theses: (i) The quark energy-momentum and the quark spin are described correctly by the canonical (Noether) currents T and S, respectively. (ii) The gluon energy-momentum current is described correctly by the (symmetric and gauge invariant) Minkowski type current. Its (Lorentz) spin current vanishes, S = 0. However, it carries helicity of plus or minus one. (iii) GR contradicts thesis (i), but is compatible with thesis (ii). (iv) Within the viable EC-theory, our theses (i) and (ii) are fulfilled and, thus, we favor this gravitational theory. ",

We find that the vacuum is stable with respect to pair production in the presence of our charged boson stars. We also study the motion of charged, massive test particles in the space-time of boson stars. We find that in contrast to charged black holes the motion of charged test particles in charged boson star space-times is planar, but that the presence of the scalar field plays a crucial role for the qualitative features of the trajectories. Applications of this test particle motion can be made in the study of extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as well as astrophysical plasmas relevant e.g. in the formation of accretion discs and polar jets of compact objects.

In this context, we investigate the possibility that wormholes could be supported by quark matter at extreme densities. Theoretical and experimental investigations of the structure of baryons show that strange quark matter, consisting of the u, d and s quarks, is the most energetically favorable state of baryonic matter. Moreover, at ultra-high densities, quark matter may exist in a variety of superconducting states, namely, the Color-Flavor-Locked (CFL) phase. Motivated by these theoretical models, we explore the conditions under which wormhole geometries may be supported by the equations of state considered in the theoretical investigations of quark-gluon interactions. For the description of the normal quark matter we adopt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) bag model equation of state, while the color superconducting quark phases are described by a first order approximation of the free energy. By assuming specific forms for the bag and gap functions, several wormhole models are obtained for both normal and superconducting quark matter. The effects of the presence of an electrical charge are also taken into account. ",

The solutions of the dynamical system have a singularity at the big bang. We study if the solutions can be regularized at the singularity in the sense of whether they have unique branch extensions through the singularity. In particular, we consider the model in which the contracting universe is dominated by a scalar field with a time varying equation of state $w$, which approaches a constant value $w_c$ near the singularity. We prove that, for $w_c > 1$, the solutions are regularizable only for a discrete set of $w_c$ values that satisfy a coprime number condition.

In particular, we will show that by imposing the renormalized vacuum energy-momentum tensor to be conserved and compatible with cosmological observations, the vacuum energy of sufficiently heavy fields behaves at late times as non-relativistic matter rather than as a cosmological constant. In this limit, the vacuum state supports perturbations whose speed of sound is negligible and accordingly allows the growth of structures in the vacuum energy itself.

    "abstract": "  This article serves as a pedagogical introduction to the problem of motion in classical field theories. The primary focus is on self-interaction: How does an object's own field affect its motion? General laws governing the self-force and self-torque are derived using simple, non-perturbative arguments. The relevant concepts are developed gradually by considering motion in a series of increasingly complicated theories. Newtonian gravity is discussed first, then Klein-Gordon theory, electromagnetism, and finally general relativity. Linear and angular momenta as well as centers of mass are defined in each of these cases. Multipole expansions for the force and torque are then derived to all orders for arbitrarily self-interacting extended objects. These expansions are found to be structurally identical to the laws of motion satisfied by extended test bodies, except that all relevant fields are replaced by effective versions which exclude the self-fields in a particular sense. Regularization methods traditionally associated with self-interacting point particles arise as straightforward perturbative limits of these (more fundamental) results. Additionally, generic mechanisms are discussed which dynamically shift --- i.e., renormalize --- the apparent multipole moments associated with self-interacting extended bodies. Although this is primarily a synthesis of earlier work, several new results and interpretations are included as well. ",

    "abstract": "  Higgs inflation has received a remarkable attention in the last few years due to its simplicity and predictive power. The key point of this model is the nonminimal coupling to gravity in unitary gauge. As such, this theory is in fact a scalar-tensor modification of gravity that needs to be studied also below the energy scales of inflation. Motivated by this goal, we study in great analytical and numerical detail the static and spherically symmetric solutions of the equations of motion in the presence of standard baryonic matter, called \"Higgs monopoles\" and presented in 1305.2640. These particlelike solutions may arise naturally in tensor-scalar gravity with mexican hat potential and are the only globally regular asymptotically flat solutions with finite classical energy. In the case when the parameters of the potential are taken to be the ones of the standard model, we find that the deviations from general relativity are extremely small, especially for bodies of astrophysical size and density. This allows to derive a simplified description of the monopole, for which the metric inside the spherical matter distribution can be approximated by the standard metric of general relativity. We study how the properties of these monopoles depend on the strength of the nonminimal coupling to gravity and on the baryonic mass and compactness. An important and original result is the existence of a mechanism of resonant amplification of the Higgs field inside the monopole that comes into play for large nonminimal coupling. We show that this mechanism might degenerate into divergences of the Higgs field that reveal the existence of forbidden combinations of radius and baryonic energy density. ",

    "abstract": "  The hydrodynamic vortex, an effective spacetime geometry for propagating sound waves, is studied analytically. In contrast with the familiar Kerr black-hole spacetime, the hydrodynamic vortex model is described by an effective acoustic geometry which has no horizons. However, this acoustic spacetime possesses an ergoregion, a property which it shares with the rotating Kerr spacetime. It has recently been shown numerically that this physical system is linearly unstable due to the superradiant scattering of sound waves in the ergoregion of the effective spacetime. In the present study we use analytical tools in order to explore the onset of these superradiant instabilities which characterize the effective spacetime geometry. In particular, we derive a simple analytical formula which describes the physical properties of the hydrodynamic vortex system in its critical (marginally-stable) state, the state which marks the boundary between stable and unstable fluid configurations. The analytically derived formula is shown to agree with the recently published numerical data for the hydrodynamic vortex system. ",

The dynamical evolution of the Kantowski-Sachs and Bianchi-I universes are analyzed in depth. In both situations in order for solutions to exist and at the same time to avoid finite time future singularities, bounds on the value of the cosmological constant and on the values of the Skyrme couplings must be set. The upper bound on the cosmological constant, which depends also on the initial conditions is closely related to the fact that the baryons appear below 1 GeV. The upper bound on the cosmological constant is actually 72 orders of magnitudes lower than the standard estimations from quantum field theory. The lower bound on the cosmological constant and the bounds on the Skyrme couplings are due to the peculiar combination of nonlinear terms in the Skyrme model. It is worth to point out that bounds on the Skyrme couplings occur in similar fashion both for the Kantowski-Sachs and for the Bianchi-I models which are topologically completely different. Our results suggest that this behavior is intrinsic to the coupling of the Skyrme field to gravity rather than on a specific cosmological model. ",

One of the tests is checking whether GW propagates with the speed of light or not. This test is crucial because the velocity of GW has not ever been directly measured. Propagation speed of a GW can deviate from the speed of light due to the modification of gravity, graviton mass, and the nontrivial spacetime structure such as extra dimensions and quantum gravity effects. Here we report a simple method to measure the propagation speed of a GW by directly comparing arrival times between gravitational waves, and neutrinos from supernovae or photons from short gamma-ray bursts. As a result, we found that the future multimessenger observations of a GW, neutrinos, and photons can test the GW propagation speed with the precision of ~10^{-16} improving the previous suggestions by 8-10 orders of magnitude. We also propose a novel method that distinguishes the true signal due to the deviation of GW propagation speed from the speed of light and the intrinsic time delay of the emission at a source by looking at the redshift dependence.

More specifically, we consider an equation of state in which the sum of the energy density and radial pressure is proportional to a constant with a value smaller than that of the inverse area characterising the system, i.e., the area of the wormhole mouth. This approach is motivated by a recently proposed cosmological event, denoted \"the little sibling of the big rip\", where the Hubble rate and the scale factor blow up but the cosmic derivative of the Hubble rate does not [1]. By using the cut-and-paste approach, we match interior spherically symmetric wormhole solutions to an exterior Schwarzschild geometry, and analyze the stability of the thin-shell to linearized spherically symmetric perturbations around static solutions, by choosing suitable properties for the exotic material residing on the junction interface radius. Furthermore, we also consider an inhomogeneous generalisation of the equation of state considered above and analyse the respective stability regions. In particular, we obtain a specific wormhole solution with an asymptotic behaviour corresponding to a global monopole. ",

    "abstract": "  We consider a novel approach to address the black hole information paradox (BHIP). The idea is based on adapting, to the situation at hand, the modified versions of quantum theory involving spontaneous stochastic dynamical collapse of quantum states, which have been considered in attempts to deal with shortcomings of the standard Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, in particular, the issue known as \"the measurement problem\". The new basic hypothesis is that the modified quantum behavior is enhanced in the region of high curvature so that the information encoded in the initial quantum state of the matter fields is rapidly erased as the black hole singularity is approached. We show that in this manner the complete evaporation of the black hole via Hawking radiation can be understood as involving no paradox. Calculations are performed using a modified version of quantum theory known as \"Continuous Spontaneous Localization\" (CSL), which was originally developed in the context of many particle non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We use a version of CSL tailored to quantum field theory and applied in the context of the two dimensional Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) model. Although the role of quantum gravity in this picture is restricted to the resolution of the singularity, related studies suggest that there might be further connections. ",

    "abstract": "  Lattice regularization is a standard technique for the nonperturbative definition of a quantum theory of fields. Several approaches to the construction of a quantum theory of gravity adopt this technique either explicitly or implicitly. A crucial complement to lattice regularization is the process of renormalization through which a continuous description of the quantum theory arises. I provide a comprehensive conceptual discussion of the renormalization of lattice-regularized quantum gravity models. I begin with a presentation of the renormalization group from the Wilsonian perspective. I then consider the application of the renormalization group in four contexts: quantum field theory on a continuous nondynamical spacetime, quantum field theory on a lattice-regularized nondynamical spacetime, quantum field theory of continuous dynamical spacetime, and quantum field theory of lattice-regularized dynamical spacetime. The first three contexts serve to identify successively the particular issues that arise in the fourth context. These issues originate in the inescability of establishing all scales solely on the basis of the dynamics. While most of this discussion rehearses established knowledge, the attention that I pay to these issues, especially the previously underappreciated role of standard units of measure, is largely novel. I conclude by briefly reviewing past studies of renormalization of lattice-regularized quantum gravity models. In the second paper of this two-part series, I illustrate the ideas presented here by proposing a renormalization group scheme for causal dynamical triangulations. ",

This length is generally identified with the Planck length, or the string length, but it could be also much longer down to the TeV region. A simple and effective way to keep track of the effects the minimal length in black hole geometries is to solve the Einstein equations with an energy momentum tensor describing non point-like matter. The immediate consequence is the absence of any curvature singularity. Where textbook solutions of the Einstein equations loose any physical meaning because of infinite tidal forces, we find a de Sitter vacuum core of high, but finite, energy density and pressure. An additional improvement regards the final stage of the black hole evaporation leading to a vanishing Hawking temperature even in the neutral, non-rotating, case. In spite of th simplicity of this model we are able to describe the final stage of the black hole evaporation, resulting in a cold remnant with a degenerate, extremal, horizon of radius of the order of the minimal length. In this chapter we shall describe only neutral, spherically symmetric, regular black holes although charged, rotating and higher dimensional black holes can be found in the literature. ",

The consequences of this unstable phase to the background spacetime have not been addressed so far due to known difficulties concerning backreaction in semiclassical gravity. It seems reasonable to believe, however, that the quantum fluctuations will \"classicalize\" when they become large enough, after which backreaction can be treated in the general-relativistic context. Here we investigate the emergence of a classical regime out of the quantum field evolution during the unstable phase. By studying the appearance of classical correlations and loss of quantum coherence, we show that by the time backreaction becomes important the system already behaves classically. Consequently, the gravity-induced instability leads naturally to initial conditions for the eventual classical description of the backreaction. Our results give support to previous analyses which treat classically the instability of scalar fields in the spacetime of relativistic stars, regardless whether the instability is triggered by classical or quantum perturbations.

This is done using an iterative algorithm, taking as an initial guess the background cosmological evolution obtained using standard general relativity in the absence of a cosmological constant. We show that, in general, the impact of the vacuum energy sequestering mechanism on the dynamics of the universe is significant, except for the $w=1/3$ case where the results are identical to those obtained in the context of general relativity with a null cosmological constant. We also show that there are well behaved models in general relativity that do not have a well behaved counterpart in the vacuum energy sequestering paradigm studied in this paper, highlighting the specific case of a quintessence scalar field with a linear potential.

Practically, symmetries provide a useful mathematical tool in physical problems since they can be used to simplify a given system of differential equations as well as to determine the integrability of the physical system. The requirement that the field equations admit dynamical symmetries results in two potentials one of which is the well known Unified Dark Matter (UDM) potential and another new potential. For each hyperbolic potential we obtain the corresponding analytic solution of the field equations. The proposed analysis suggests that the requirement of the contact symmetry appears to be very competitive to other independent tests used to probe the functional form of a given potential and thus the associated nature of dark energy. Finally, in order to test the viability of the above scalar field models we perform a joint likelihood analysis using some of the latest cosmological data. ",

    "abstract": "  Based on a recent purely geometric construction of observables for the spatial diffeomorphism constraint, we propose two distinct quantum reductions to spherical symmetry within full 3+1-dimensional loop quantum gravity. The construction of observables corresponds to using the radial gauge for the spatial metric and allows to identify rotations around a central observer as unitary transformations in the quantum theory. Group averaging over these rotations yields our first proposal for spherical symmetry. Hamiltonians of the full theory with angle-independent lapse preserve this spherically symmetric subsector of the full Hilbert space. A second proposal consists in implementing the vanishing of a certain vector field in spherical symmetry as a constraint on the full Hilbert space, leading to a close analogue of diffeomorphisms invariant states. While this second set of spherically symmetric states does not allow for using the full Hamiltonian, it is naturally suited to implement the spherically symmetric midisuperspace Hamiltonian, as an operator in the full theory, on it. Due to the canonical structure of the reduced variables, the holonomy-flux algebra behaves effectively as a one parameter family of 2+1-dimensional algebras along the radial coordinate, leading to a diagonal non-vanishing volume operator on 3-valent vertices. The quantum dynamics thus becomes tractable, including scenarios like spherically symmetric dust collapse. ",

Choosing the timelike coordinate aligned with the khronon, the static metric takes a simple form, from which it can be seen clearly that the metric is free of singularity at the Killing horizon, but becomes singular at the universal horizon. Applying such developed formulas to three well-known black hole solutions, the Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter, and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om, we find that in all these solutions universal horizons exist and are always inside the Killing horizons. In particular, in the Eddington-Finkelstein and Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates, in which the metrics are not singular when crossing both of the Killing and universal horizons, the peeling-off behavior of the khronon is found only at the universal horizons, whereby we show that the values of surface gravity of the universal horizons calculated from the peeling-off behavior of the khronon match with those obtained from the covariant definition given recently by Cropp, Liberati, Mohd and Visser.

The transition point leads to a state of silence, characterized by a vanishing speed of light. This behavior can be interpreted as a decoupling of different space points, similar to the one characterizing the BKL phase.   In this study, we address the issue of imposing initial conditions for the cosmological perturbations at the transition point between the Lorentzian and Euclidean phases. Motivated by the decoupling of space points, initial conditions characterized by a lack of correlations are investigated. We show that the \"white noise\" initial conditions are supported by the analysis of the vacuum state in the Euclidean regime adjacent to the state of silence.   Furthermore, the possibility of imposing the silent initial conditions at the trans-Planckian surface, characterized by a vanishing speed for the propagation of modes with wavelengths of the order of the Planck length, is studied. Such initial conditions might result from a loop-deformations of the Poincar\\'e algebra. The conversion of the silent initial power spectrum to a scale-invariant one is also examined. ",

These hypotheses include, in particular, locality, covariance, scaling, microlocal regularity and continuous and analytic dependence on the metric and coupling parameters. The analytic dependence hypothesis is somewhat unnatural, because it requires that locally covariant observables (which are simultaneously defined on all spacetimes) depend continuously on an arbitrary metric, with the dependence strengthened to analytic on analytic metrics. Moreover the fact that analytic metrics are globally rigid makes the implementation of this requirement at the level of local $*$-algebras of observables rather technically cumbersome. We show that the conditions of locality, covariance, scaling and a naturally strengthened microlocal spectral condition, are actually sufficient to constrain the allowed finite renormalizations equally strongly, thus eliminating both the continuity and the somewhat unnatural analyticity hypotheses. The key step in the proof uses the Peetre-Slov\\'ak theorem on the characterization of (in general non-linear) differential operators by their locality and regularity properties. ",

As is well known from standard cosmological perturbation theory, under the assumption of initial quantum vacuum fluctuations the Fourier modes of the comoving curvature perturbation that exit the (sound) Hubble radius in such a contracting universe at a time of matter-domination will be nearly scale-invariant. Furthermore, the modes that exit the (sound) Hubble radius when the effective equation of state is slightly negative due to the cosmological constant will have a slight red tilt, in agreement with observations. We assume that loop quantum cosmology captures the correct high-curvature dynamics of the space-time, and this ensures that the big-bang singularity is resolved and is replaced by a bounce. We calculate the evolution of the perturbations through the bounce and find that they remain nearly scale-invariant. We also show that the amplitude of the scalar perturbations in this cosmology depends on a combination of the sound speed of cold dark matter, the Hubble rate in the contracting branch at the time of equality of the energy densities of cold dark matter and radiation, and the curvature scale that the loop quantum cosmology bounce occurs at. Importantly, as this scenario predicts a positive running of the scalar index, observations can potentially differentiate between it and inflationary models.

Regarding the TE, the recent literature presents difficulties related to its stochastic derivation and interpretation, advocating the use of the RSEAC to properly describe the relativistic diffusion phenomena. Taking into account that the Lorentz symmetry is broken in UV regime at Lifshitz point, we show that there exists a degeneracy in very high energies, meaning that both the RSEAC and the TE correctly describe the diffusion processes at these energy scales, at least under the spectral dimension criterion. In fact, both the equations yield the same result, namely, $d_s = 2$, a dimensional reduction that is compatible with several theories of quantum gravity. This result is reached even when one takes into account a cosmological model - the De Sitter one - for a flat Universe. On the other hand, in the IR regimen, such degeneracy is lifted in favor of the approach via TE, due to the fact that only this equation provides the correct value for $d_s$, which is equal to the actual number of spacetime dimensions, i. e., $d_s = 4$, while RSEAC furnishes $d_s=3$, so that a diffusing particle described by this latter experiences a three-dimensional spacetime.

As long as quantum gravity preserves the symmetries of the low energy effective field theory, we find that the bounds on the number of quantum black holes or remnants are very weak. Typically we rule out using data on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon that there are more than $10^{32}$ quantum black holes coupled to the standard model particles gravitationally. Remnants thus remain a viable option as a solution to the information paradox of black holes. ",

    "abstract": "  We review work on the formation of gravitino condensates via the super-Higgs effect in the early Universe. This is a scenario for both inflating the early universe and breaking local supersymmetry (supergravity), entirely independent of any coupling to external matter. The goldstino mode associated with the breaking of (global) supersymmetry is \"eaten\" by the gravitino field, which becomes massive (via its own vacuum condensation) and breaks the local supersymmetry (supergravity) dynamically. The most natural association of gravitino condensates with inflation proceeds in an indirect way, via a Starobinsky-inflation-type phase. The higher-order curvature corrections of the (quantum) effective action of gravitino condensates induced by integrating out massive gravitino degrees of freedom in a curved space-time background, in the broken-supergravity phase, are responsible for inducing a scalar mode which inflates the Universe. The scenario is in agreement with Planck data phenomenology in a natural and phenomenologically-relevant range of parameters, namely Grand-Unified-Theory values for the supersymmetry breaking energy scale and dynamically-induced gravitino mass.

Using the power of the holomorphic integration techniques, and with the introduction of two new tools: the homogeneity map and the loop identity, for the first time we give the analytic expressions for the behaviour of the Spin Foam amplitudes under 4-dimensional Pachner moves. It turns out that this behaviour is controlled by an insertion of nonlocal mixing operators. In the case of the 5-1 move, the expression governing the change of the amplitude can be interpreted as a vertex renormalisation equation. We find a natural truncation scheme that allows us to get an invariance up to an overall factor for the 4-2 and 5-1 moves, but not for the 3-3 move. The study of the divergences shows that there is a range of parameter space for which the 4-2 move is finite while the 5-1 move diverges. This opens up the possibility to recover diffeomorphism invariance in the continuum limit of Spin Foam models for 4D Quantum Gravity. ",

    "abstract": "  We study the thermodynamical properties of black holes when described as gases of indistinguishable punctures with a chemical potential. In this picture, which arises from loop quantum gravity, the black hole microstates are defined by finite families of half-integers spins coloring the punctures, and the near-horizon energy measured by quasi-local stationary observers defines the various thermodynamical ensembles. The punctures carry excitations of quantum geometry in the form of quanta of area, and the total horizon area $a_\\text{H}$ is given by the sum of these microscopic contributions. We assume here that the system satisfies the Bose-Einstein statistics, and that each microstate is degenerate with a holographic degeneracy given by $\\exp\\big(\\lambda a_\\text{H}/\\ell_\\text{Pl}^2\\big)$ and $\\lambda>0$. We analyze in detail the thermodynamical properties resulting from these inputs, and in particular compute the grand canonical entropy. We explain why the requirements that the temperature be fixed to the Unruh temperature and that the chemical potential vanishes do not specify completely the semi-classical regime of large horizon area, and classify in turn what the various regimes can be. When the degeneracy saturates the holographic bound ($\\lambda=1/4$), there exists a semi-classical regime in which the subleading corrections to the entropy are logarithmic. Furthermore, this regime corresponds to a Bose-Einstein condensation, in the sense that it is dominated by punctures carrying the minimal (or ground state) spin value $1/2$. ",

    "abstract": "  Instead of formulating the state space of a quantum field theory over one big Hilbert space, it has been proposed by Kijowski to describe quantum states as projective families of density matrices over a collection of smaller, simpler Hilbert spaces. Beside the physical motivations for this approach, it could help designing a quantum state space holding the states we need. In [Oko{\\l}\\'ow 2013, arXiv:1304.6330] the description of a theory of Abelian connections within this framework was developed, an important insight being to use building blocks labeled by combinations of edges and surfaces. The present work generalizes this construction to an arbitrary gauge group G (in particular, G is neither assumed to be Abelian nor compact). This involves refining the definition of the label set, as well as deriving explicit formulas to relate the Hilbert spaces attached to different labels.   If the gauge group happens to be compact, we also have at our disposal the well-established Ashtekar-Lewandowski Hilbert space, which is defined as an inductive limit using building blocks labeled by edges only. We then show that the quantum state space presented here can be thought as a natural extension of the space of density matrices over this Hilbert space. In addition, it is manifest from the classical counterparts of both formalisms that the projective approach allows for a more balanced treatment of the holonomy and flux variables, so it might pave the way for the development of more satisfactory coherent states.

This suppression can occur by introducing a phase transition from the fast-roll phase to the slow-roll phase in a single field inflation model. In this paper we consider a deformed single field inflation model in terms of three SO(3) symmetric moduli fields. We find that spatially linear solutions for the moduli fields induces a phase transition during the early stage of the inflation and the suppression of scalar power spectrum at large scale perturbation modes.

    "abstract": "  SgrA$^*$, the supermassive black hole candidate at the Galactic Center, exhibits flares in the X-ray, NIR, and sub-mm bands that may be interpreted within a hot spot model. Light curves and images of hot spots orbiting a black hole are affected by a number of special and general relativistic effects, and they can be potentially used to check whether the object is a Kerr black hole of general relativity. However, in a previous study we have shown that the relativistic features are usually subdominant with respect to the background noise and the model-dependent properties of the hot spot, and eventually it is at most possible to estimate the frequency of the innermost stable circular orbit. In this case, tests of the Kerr metric are only possible in combination with other measurements. In the present work, we consider a class of non-Kerr spacetimes in which the hot spot orbit may be outside the equatorial plane. These metrics are difficult to constrain from the study of accretion disks and indeed current X-ray observations of stellar-mass and supermassive black hole candidates cannot put interesting bounds. Here we show that near future observations of SgrA$^*$ may do it. If the hot spot is sufficiently close to the massive object, the image affected by Doppler blueshift is brighter than the other one and this provides a specific observational signature in the hot spot's centroid track. We conclude that accurate astrometric observations of SgrA$^*$ with an instrument like GRAVITY should be able to test this class of metrics, except in the more unlikely case of a small viewing angle.

Numerical integration of the associated Klein-Gordon equation using accessible experimental parameters shows that gravity waves in an appropriate frequency range are amplified through the mechanism of superradiance. Our numerical results suggest that the observation of this phenomenon in a common fluid mechanical system is within experimental reach. Unlike the case of wave scattering around Kerr black holes, which depends only on one dimensionless background parameter (the ratio $a/M$ between the specific angular momentum and the mass of the black hole), our system depends on two dimensionless background parameters, namely the normalized angular velocity and surface gravity at the effective black hole horizon.

    "abstract": "  The scalar wave equation in Kasner spacetime is solved, first for a particular choice of Kasner parameters, by relating the integrand in the wave packet to the Bessel functions. An alternative integral representation is also displayed, which relies upon the method of integration in the complex domain for the solution of hyperbolic equations with variable coefficients. In order to study the propagation of wave fronts, we integrate the equations of bicharacteristics which are null geodesics, and we are able to express them, for the first time in the literature, with the help of elliptic integrals for another choice of Kasner parameters. For generic values of the three Kasner parameters, the solution of the Cauchy problem is built through a pair of integral operators, where the amplitude and phase functions in the integrand solve a coupled system of partial differential equations. The first is the so-called transport equation, whereas the second is a nonlinear equation that reduces to the eikonal equation if the amplitude is a slowly varying function. Remarkably, the analysis of such a coupled system is proved to be equivalent to building first an auxiliary covariant vector having vanishing divergence, while all nonlinearities are mapped into solving a covariant generalization of the Ermakov-Pinney equation for the amplitude function. Last, from a linear set of equations for the gradient of the phase one recovers the phase itself. This is the parametrix construction that relies upon Fourier-Maslov integral operators, but with a novel perspective on the nonlinearities in the dispersion relation. Furthermore, the Adomian method for nonlinear partial differential equations is applied to generate a recursive scheme for the evaluation of the amplitude function in the parametrix. ",

In this work we examine whether the characteristics of the electromagnetic counterparts to these binaries -- driven by magnetosphere interactions prior to the merger event -- can provide an independent way to test gravity in the most strongly dynamical stages of binary mergers. We find that the electromagnetic flux emitted by binaries in these scalar-tensor theories can show deviations from the GR prediction in particular cases. These differences are quite subtle, thus requiring delicate measurements to differentiate between GR and the type of scalar-tensor theories considered in this work using electromagnetic observations alone.

    "abstract": "  Is the Hawking flux \"thermal\"? Unfortunately, the answer to this seemingly innocent question depends on a number of often unstated, but quite crucial, technical assumptions built into modern (mis-)interpretations of the word \"thermal\". The original 1850's notions of thermality --- based on classical thermodynamic reasoning applied to idealized \"black bodies\" or \"lamp black surfaces\" --- when supplemented by specific basic quantum ideas from the early 1900's, immediately led to the notion of the black-body spectrum, (the Planck-shaped spectrum), but \"without\" any specific assumptions or conclusions regarding correlations between the quanta. Many (not all) modern authors (often implicitly and unintentionally) add an extra, and quite unnecessary, assumption that there are no correlations in the black-body radiation; but such usage is profoundly ahistorical and dangerously misleading. Specifically, the Hawking flux from an evaporating black hole, (just like the radiation flux from a leaky furnace or a burning lump of coal), is only \"approximately\" Planck-shaped over a bounded frequency range. Standard physics (phase space and adiabaticity effects) explicitly bound the frequency range over which the Hawking flux is \"approximately\" Planck-shaped from both above and below --- the Hawking flux is certainly not exactly Planckian, and there is no compelling physics reason to assume the Hawking photons are uncorrelated.

The PWTM aims to produce a non-thermal HR which adumbrates the resolution of the problem of unitarity in quantum mechanics (QM), and consequently the entropy (or information) conservation problem. The effectiveness of the method has been satisfactorily tested on numerous black holes (BHs). However, it has been shown that the isothermal HR, which results from the emission of the uncharged particles of the linear dilaton BH (LDBH) described in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory, the PWTM has vulnerability in having non-thermal radiation. In particular, we consider Painlev\\'e-Gullstrand coordinates (PGCs) and isotropic coordinates (ICs) in order to prove the aformentioned failure in the PWTM. While carrying out calculations in the ICs, we also highlight the effect of the refractive index on the null geodesics. ",

The blueshifted rays are expected to perturb the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation along the lines of sight of the present central observer. It is shown here that, in a general L--T model, the $t_B(r)$ can be chosen so that the blueshift-generating region is hidden before the recombination time, where the L--T model does not apply. The rest of the paper is devoted to investigating blueshifts in one specific L--T model, called L--T$(t_B)$ -- the one that duplicates the luminosity distance vs. redshift relation of the $\\Lambda$CDM model using nonconstant $t_B(r)$ alone. The location of the blueshift-generating region in the L--T$(t_B)$ spacetime is determined. Profiles of redshift/blueshift along several rays intersecting the past light cone of the present central observer are calculated. The L--T$(t_B)$ model matched to Friedmann is considered, and profiles of redshift/blueshift in such a composite model are calculated. The requirement of invisibility of blueshifts makes the L--T$(t_B)$ model astrophysically unacceptable if it should apply back to the recombination time, but does not \"rule out\" a general L--T model -- it only puts limits on $\\dril {t_B} r$.

A general property of such a surface is that there exist linear combinations of the Killing vectors with constant coefficients which make them orthogonal on it.

    "abstract": "  The detection and characterization of gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescence events relies on accurate waveform templates in the frequency domain. The stationary phase approximation (SPA) can be used to compute closed-form frequency-domain waveforms for non-precessing, quasi-circular binary inspirals. However, until now, no fast frequency-domain waveforms have existed for generic, spin-precessing quasi-circular compact binary inspirals. Templates for these systems have had to be computed via a discrete Fourier transform of finely sampled time-domain waveforms, which is far more computationally expensive than those constructed directly in the frequency-domain, especially for those systems that are dominated by the inspiral part. There are two obstacles to deriving frequency-domain waveforms for precessing systems: (i) the spin-precession equations do not admit closed-form solutions for generic systems; (ii) the SPA fails catastrophically. Presently there is no general solution to the first problem, so we must resort to numerical integration of the spin precession equations. This is not a significant obstacle, as numerical integration on the slow precession timescale adds very little to the computational cost of generating the waveforms. Our main result is to solve the second problem, by providing an alternative to the SPA that we call the method of Shifted Uniform Asymptotics, or SUA, that cures the divergences in the SPA. The construction of frequency-domain templates using the SUA can be orders of magnitude more efficient than the time-domain ones obtained through a discrete Fourier transform. Moreover, this method is very faithful to the discrete Fourier transform, with mismatches on the order of $10^{-5}$. ",

Our main theorem establishes that if the manifold is asymptotically flat and has non-negative scalar curvature distribution, then its (generalized) ADM mass is well-defined and non-negative, and vanishes only if the manifold is isometric to Euclidian space. Prior applications of Witten's spinor method by Lee and Parker and by Bartnik required the much stronger regularity $W^{2,2}$. Our proof is a generalization of Witten's arguments, in which we must treat the Dirac operator and its associated Lichnerowicz-Weitzenbock identity in the distributional sense and cope with certain averages of first-order derivatives of the metric over annuli that approach infinity.

The possible relevance for rather different quantum-gravity models has motivated several studies, but this interest is being tempered by concerns that a nonlinear law of addition of momenta might inevitably produce a pathological description of the total momentum of a macroscopic body. I here show that such concerns are unjustified, finding that they are rooted in failure to appreciate the differences between two roles for laws composition of momentum in physics. Previous results relied exclusively on the role of a law of momentum composition in the description of spacetime locality. However, the notion of total momentum of a multi-particle system is not a manifestation of locality, but rather reflects translational invariance. By working within an illustrative example of quantum spacetime I show explicitly that spacetime locality is indeed reflected in a nonlinear law of composition of momenta, but translational invariance still results in an undeformed linear law of addition of momenta building up the total momentum of a multi-particle system.

    "abstract": "  We construct and study Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) when the Barbero-Immirzi parameter takes the complex value $\\gamma=\\pm i$. We refer to this new quantum cosmology as complex Loop Quantum Cosmology. We proceed in making an analytic continuation of the Hamiltonian constraint (with no inverse volume corrections) from real $\\gamma$ to $\\gamma=\\pm i$ in the simple case of a flat FLRW Universe coupled to a massless scalar field with no cosmological constant. For that purpose, we first compute the non-local curvature operator (defined by the trace of the holonomy of the connection around a fundamental plaquette) evaluated in any spin $j$ representation and we find a new close formula for it. This allows to define explicitly a one parameter family of regularizations of the Hamiltonian constraint in LQC, parametrized by the spin $j$. It is immediate to see that any spin $j$ regularization leads to a bounce scenario. Then, motivated particularly by previous results on black hole thermodynamics, we perform the analytic continuation of the Hamiltonian constraint defined by $\\gamma=\\pm i$ and $j=-1/2+is$ where $s$ is real. Even if the area spectrum is now continuous, we show that the so-defined complex LQC removes also the original singularity which is replaced by a quantum bounce. In addition, the maximal density and the minimal volume of the Universe are obviously independent of $\\gamma$. Furthermore, the dynamics before and after the bounce are no more symmetric, which makes a clear distinction between these two phases of the evolution of the Universe. ",

The shadow of a black hole is found to be a dark zone covered by deformed circle. Interestingly, the shapes of the black hole shadow are more distorted and size decreases for larger black hole spins. Interestingly, it turns out that, for fixed values of rotation parameter, the shadow is slightly smaller and less deformed than for its four-dimensional Kerr black counterpart.

    "abstract": "  Coalescing neutron-star-black-hole (NS-BH) binaries are a promising source of gravitational-wave (GW) signals detectable with large-scale laser interferometers such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo. They are also one of the main short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) progenitor candidates. If the BH tidally disrupts its companion, an SGRB may be ignited when a sufficiently massive accretion disk forms around the remnant BH. Detecting an NS-BH coalescence both in the GW and electromagnetic (EM) spectrum offers a wealth of information about the nature of the source. How much can actually be inferred from a joint detection is unclear, however, as a mass/spin degeneracy may reduce the GW measurement accuracy. To shed light on this problem and on the potential of joint EM+GW observations, we here combine recent semi-analytical predictions for the remnant disk mass with estimates of the parameter-space portion that is selected by a GW detection. We identify cases in which an SGRB ignition is supported, others in which it can be excluded, and finally others in which the outcome depends on the chosen model for the currently unknown NS equation of state. We pinpoint a range of systems that would allow us to place lower bounds on the equation of state stiffness if both the GW emission and its EM counterpart are observed. The methods we develop can broaden the scope of existing GW detection and parameter-estimation algorithms and could allow us to disregard about half of the templates in an NS-BH search following an SGRB trigger, increasing its speed and sensitivity.

To address this question, a set of conditions is shown to be sufficient for showing the positivity of a Hamiltonian operator corresponding to the ADM energy. One of these conditions is a particular factor ordering for the constraints of general relativity, in a representation where the states are functionals of the Ashtekar connection, and the auxiliary, Witten spinor.   These developments are partly based on results derived with Artem Starodubtsev (unpublished notes, 2004). ",

Although our approach is linear, the waveforms' parameter dependence may be non-linear. For the case of gravitational waves from rotating core collapse, we show, using statistical hypothesis testing, that our method is capable of identifying the most important physical parameters that govern waveform morphology in the presence of simulated detector noise.

Contrary to the closely related Kundt class and pp-waves, the corresponding off-diagonal metric components thus do not encode the angular momentum of some gyraton.

We discuss how both EM source information and GW source localization can be used in a framework of multi-messenger astronomy. We illustrate how the large error regions in GW sky localizations can be handled in conducting optical astronomy in the advance detector era.

It was found that the effective density introduces an effective pressure that becomes negative and dominant in the strong-field regime. With this set-up, the central singularity is replaced by a bounce, after which the cloud starts expanding. Motivated by the fact that in the classical case homogeneous and inhomogeneous collapse models have different properties, here we extend our previous work to the inhomogeneous case. As in the quantum-inspired homogeneous collapse model, the classical central singularity is replaced by a bounce, but the inhomogeneities strongly affect the structure of the bounce curve and of the trapped region.

It is assumed that the observed magnetic fields result from the amplification of an initial field produced in the early universe. In this paper we compute the exact power spectrum of magnetic fields created after inflation best known as post inflationary magnetic fields, using the first order cosmological perturbation theory. Our treatment differs from others works because we include an infrared cutoff which encodes only causal modes in the spectrum. The cross-correlation between magnetic energy density with Lorentz force and the anisotropic part of the electromagnetic field are exactly computed. We compare our results with previous works finding agreement in cases where the ratio between lower and upper cutoff is very small. However, we found that spectrum is strongly affected when this ratio is greater than 0.2. Moreover, the effect of a post inflationary magnetic field with a lower cutoff on the angular power spectrum in the temperature distribution of CMB was also exactly calculated. The main feature is a shift of the spectrum's peak as function of the infrared cutoff, therefore analyzing this effect we could infer the value of this cutoff and thus constraining the primordial magnetic fields generation models.

It is not obvious that the horizon entropy of these spacetimes is also one quarter of the area of horizon, like the stationary ones. Here I study this topic in the context of Virasoro algebra and Cardy formula. Using the fact that the conformal spacetime admits conformal Killing vector and the horizon is determined by the vanishing of the norm of it, the diffemorphisms are obtained which keep the near horizon structure invariant. The Noether charge and a bracket among them corresponding to these vectors are calculated in this region. Finally, they are evaluated for the Sultana-Dyer (SD) black hole, which is conformal to the Schwarzschild metric. It is found that the bracket is identical to the usual Virasoro algebra with the central extension. Identifying the zero mode eigenvalue and the central charge, the entropy of the SD horizon is obtained by using Cardy formula. Interestingly, this is again one quarter of the horizon area. Only difference in this case is that the area is modified by the conformal factor compared to that of the stationary one. The analysis gives a direct proof of the earlier assumption. ",

    "abstract": "  LISA Pathfinder (LPF), ESA's precursor mission to a gravitational wave observatory, will measure the degree to which two test-masses can be put into free-fall, aiming to demonstrate a residual relative acceleration with a power spectral density (PSD) below 30 fm/s$^2$/Hz$^{1/2}$ around 1 mHz. In LPF data analysis, the measured relative acceleration data series must be fit to other various measured time series data. This fitting is required in different experiments, from system identification of the test mass and satellite dynamics to the subtraction of noise contributions from measured known disturbances. In all cases, the background noise, described by the PSD of the fit residuals, is expected to be coloured, requiring that we perform such fits in the frequency domain. This PSD is unknown {\\it a priori}, and a high accuracy estimate of this residual acceleration noise is an essential output of our analysis. In this paper we present a fitting method based on Bayesian parameter estimation with an unknown frequency-dependent background noise. The method uses noise marginalisation in connection with averaged Welch's periodograms to achieve unbiased parameter estimation, together with a consistent, non-parametric estimate of the residual PSD. Additionally, we find that the method is equivalent to some implementations of iteratively re-weighted least-squares fitting. We have tested the method both on simulated data of known PSD, and to analyze differential acceleration from several experiments with the LISA Pathfinder end-to-end mission simulator. ",

The lambda = 1/3 case of the theory does not possess any extra mode, hence the range of alpha is in principle not limited by the linear stability of any extra mode. We study the full range of alpha, both in the positive and negative sectors. We find the same wormhole solutions and naked singularities that were found for the Einstein-aether theory in a sector of the space of alpha. There also arise wormholes in other sector of alpha. Our coordinate systems are valid at the throats of the wormholes. We also find the perturbative solutions for small alpha. We give this version of the solutions directly on the original radial coordinate r, which is particularly suitable for representing the exterior region of solutions with localized sources. ",

The use of globally defined null coordinates allows for the definition of a unique in-vacuum for the scalar field propagating in this background. Computing the stress-energy tensor for this scalar field, we work out the energy density and flux for the static observers outside the horizon and then consider the radially in-falling observers who fall in from some specified initial radius all the way through the horizon and inside to the eventual singularity. Our results confirm the thermal Tolman-shifted energy density and fluxes for the static observers which diverge at the horizon. For the in-falling observer starting from far off, both the quantities -- energy density and flux at the horizon crossing are \\emph{regular and finite}. For example, the flux at the horizon for the in-falling observer from infinity is approximately 24 times the flux for the observer at infinity. Compared with the static observers in the near-horizon region, this is quite small. Both the quantities grow as the in-fall progresses inside the horizon and diverge at the singularity. ",

We study a hypothetical population of (1.4-10)$M_\\odot$ NS-BH binaries (uniformly distributed and oriented in the sky) by employing the full post-Newtonian waveforms, which not only include contributions from various harmonics other than the dominant one (quadrupolar mode) but also the post-Newtonian amplitude corrections associated with each harmonic, of the inspiral signal expected from this system. It is expected that the GW detector network consisting of the two LIGO detectors and a Virgo detector will be joined by KAGRA and by proposed LIGO-India. We study the problem of parameter estimation with all 16 possible detector configurations. Comparing medians of error distributions obtained using FWFs with those obtained using RWFs (which only include contributions from the dominant harmonic with Newtonian amplitude) we find that the measurement accuracies for luminosity distance and the cosine of the inclination angle improve almost by a factor of 1.5-2 depending upon the network under consideration. Although the use of FWF does not improve the source localization accuracy much, the global network consisting of five detectors will improve the source localization accuracy by a factor of 4 as compared to the estimates using a 3 detector LIGO-Virgo network for the same waveform model.

In the present paper, we identify the global causal geometry of these spacetimes and, in particular, establish that weakly regular Gowdy spacetimes are future causally geodesically complete. This result extends a theorem by Ringstr\\\"om for metrics with sufficiently high regularity. We emphasize that our proof of the energy decay is based on an energy functional inspired by the Gowdy-to-Ernst transformation. In order to establish the geodesic completeness property, we prove a higher regularity property concerning the metric coefficients along timelike curves and we provide a novel analysis of the geodesic equation for Gowdy spacetimes, which does not require high-order regularity estimates. Even when sufficient regularity is assumed, our proof provides an alternative and shorter proof of the energy decay and of the geodesic completeness property for Gowdy spacetimes. ",

These \"marginally trapped surface\" Robin conditions ensure that the expansion scalars along null geodesics perpendicular to the boundary region S are non-positive, which is considered the correct mathematical model for black holes in the context of the Einstein constraint equations. Assuming a suitable form of weak cosmic censorship, the results presented in this article guarantee the existence of initial data that will evolve into a space-time containing an arbitrary number of black holes.

We give also the examples of hyperbolic and non hyperbolic type embeddings for the de Sitter metric for which there is no mapping. For the Minkowski metric where there is no Hawking radiation we consider a non trivial embedding with hyperbolic timelines, hence in the ambient space the Unruh effect takes place, and it follows that there is no mapping too.

We begin by reviewing General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory, to emphasise the similarities between them which establish a foundation upon which to build a theory of quantum gravity. We then explain, in a concise and clear manner, the steps leading from the Einstein-Hilbert action for gravity to the construction of the quantum states of geometry, known as \\emph{spin-networks}, which provide the basis for the kinematical Hilbert space of quantum general relativity. Along the way we introduce the various associated concepts of \\emph{tetrads}, \\emph{spin-connection} and \\emph{holonomies} which are a pre-requisite for understanding the LQG formalism. Having provided a minimal introduction to the LQG framework, we discuss its applications to the problems of black hole entropy and of quantum cosmology. A list of the most common criticisms of LQG is presented, which are then tackled one by one in order to convince the reader of the physical viability of the theory.   An extensive set of appendices provide accessible introductions to several key notions such as the \\emph{Peter-Weyl theorem}, \\emph{duality} of differential forms and \\emph{Regge calculus}, among others. The presentation is aimed at graduate students and researchers who have some familiarity with the tools of quantum mechanics and field theory and/or General Relativity, but are intimidated by the seeming technical prowess required to browse through the existing LQG literature. Our hope is to make the formalism appear a little less bewildering to the un-initiated and to help lower the barrier for entry into the field. ",

In particular, it is argued that the dual states of quasi-normal modes are in fact the states of CFT$_3$ which are created by operator insertions. For a scalar field in $dS_4$, quasi-normal modes which are singular on the past horizon of the south pole and decay exponentially towards the future have been considered in \\cite{Ng:2012xp, Jafferis:2013qia}, these modes lie in two complex highest-weight representation of the dS$_4$ isometry group. In this work, we present a simple group representation analysis of these modes so that the de Sitter invariance is obviously manifest. By making use of the so-called plane wave method, we will show that the quasi-normal modes correspond to one class of the unitary irreducible representation of the de Sitter group. This consideration could be generalized straightforwardly for higher-spin fields and higher dimensions, in particular, we will study the quasinormal modes for gauge and spinor fields, and, in the case of a scalar field, the generalization to higher dimensions is also obtained.

We present in this paper an analytical description of a degeneracy involving the extrinsic parameters of a compact binary coalescence gravitational-wave signal, when data from a three detector network (such as Advanced LIGO/Virgo) is available.

    "abstract": "  We apply the non-commutative Fourier transform for Lie groups to formulate the non-commutative metric representation of the Ponzano-Regge spin foam model for 3d quantum gravity. The non-commutative representation allows to express the amplitudes of the model as a first order phase space path integral, whose properties we consider. In particular, we study the asymptotic behavior of the path integral in the semi-classical limit. First, we compare the stationary phase equations in the classical limit for three different non-commutative structures corresponding to the symmetric, Duflo and Freidel-Livine-Majid quantization maps. We find that in order to unambiguously recover discrete geometric constraints for non-commutative metric boundary data through the stationary phase method, the deformation structure of the phase space must be accounted for in the variational calculus. When this is understood, our results demonstrate that the non-commutative metric representation facilitates a convenient semi-classical analysis of the Ponzano-Regge model, which yields as the dominant contribution to the amplitude the cosine of the Regge action in agreement with previous studies. We also consider the asymptotics of the ${\\rm SU}(2)$ $6j$-symbol using the non-commutative phase space path integral for the Ponzano-Regge model, and explain the connection of our results to the previous asymptotic results in terms of coherent states.

    "abstract": "  We have provided here a new class of interior solutions for anisotropic stars admitting conformal motion in higher dimensional noncommutative spacetime. The Einstein fields equations are solved by choosing a particular density distribution function of Lorentzian type \\cite{Nozari} under noncommutative geometry. Several cases with dimensions $4D$ and higher, e.g. $5D$, $6D$ and $11D$ have been discussed separately. An overall observation is that the model parameters, such as density, radial pressure, transverse pressure, anisotropy all are well behaved and represent a compact star with radius $4.17$ km. However, emphasis has been given on the acceptability of the model from physical point of view. As a consequence it is observed that higher dimensions, i.e. beyond $4D$ spacetime, exhibit several interesting yet bizarre features which are not at all untenable for a compact stellar model of strange quark type and thus dictates a possibility of its extra dimensional existence.

    "abstract": "  Gravitational waves are excellent tools to probe the foundations of General Relativity in the strongly dynamical and non-linear regime. One such foundation is Lorentz symmetry, which can be broken in the gravitational sector by the existence of a preferred time direction, and thus, a preferred frame at each spacetime point. This leads to a modification in the orbital decay rate of binary systems, and also in the generation and chirping of their associated gravitational waves. We here study whether waves emitted in the late, quasi-circular inspiral of non-spinning, neutron star binaries can place competitive constraints on two proxies of gravitational Lorentz-violation: Einstein-\\AE{}ther theory and khronometric gravity. We model the waves in the small-coupling (or decoupling) limit and in the post-Newtonian approximation, by perturbatively solving the field equations in small deformations from General Relativity and in the small-velocity/weak-gravity approximation. We assume a gravitational wave consistent with General Relativity has been detected with second- and third-generation, ground-based detectors, and with the proposed space-based mission, DECIGO, with and without coincident electromagnetic counterparts. Without a counterpart, a detection consistent with General Relativity of neutron star binaries can only place competitive constraints on gravitational Lorentz violation when using future, third-generation or space-based instruments. On the other hand, a single counterpart is enough to place constraints that are 10 orders of magnitude more stringent than current binary pulsar bounds, even when using second-generation detectors. This is because Lorentz violation forces the group velocity of gravitational waves to be different from that of light, and this difference can be very accurately constrained with coincident observations.

In many applications these models are incomplete, which both reduces the prospects of detection and leads to a systematic error in the parameter estimates. In the analysis of data from gravitational wave detectors, for example, accurate waveform templates can be computed using numerical methods, but the prohibitive cost of these simulations means this can only be done for a small handful of parameters. In this work a novel method to fold model uncertainties into data analysis is proposed; the waveform uncertainty is analytically marginalised over using with a prior distribution constructed by using Gaussian process regression to interpolate the waveform difference from a small training set of accurate templates. The method is well motivated, easy to implement, and no more computationally expensive than standard techniques. The new method is shown to perform extremely well when applied to a toy problem. While we use the application to gravitational wave data analysis to motivate and illustrate the technique, it can be applied in any context where model uncertainties exist. ",

    "abstract": "  We provide a simple analytical solution of the Friedmann equations for a universe made of stiff matter, dust matter, and dark energy. A stiff matter era is present in the cosmological model of Zel'dovich (1972) where the primordial universe is assumed to be made of a cold gas of baryons. It also occurs in certain cosmological models where dark matter is made of relativistic self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). When the energy density of the stiff matter is positive, the primordial universe is singular. It starts from a state with a vanishing scale factor and an infinite density. We consider the possibility that the energy density of the stiff matter is negative (anti-stiff matter). This happens, for example, when the BECs have an attractive self-interaction. In that case, the primordial universe is non-singular. It starts from a state in which the scale factor is finite and the energy density is equal to zero. For the sake of generality, we consider a cosmological constant of arbitrary sign. When the cosmological constant is positive, the universe asymptotically reaches a de Sitter phase where the scale factor increases exponentially rapidly. This can account for the accelerating expansion of the universe that we observe at present. When the cosmological constant is negative (anti-de Sitter), the evolution of the universe is cyclic. Therefore, depending on the sign of the energy density of the stiff matter and of the dark energy, we obtain singular and non-singular expanding or cyclic universes. ",

The base manifold $M$ is supposed to be smoothly foliated by a two-parameter family of codimension-two-surfaces which are orientable and compact without boundary in $M$. By applying a pair of nested $1+n$ and $1+[n-1]$ decompositions, the canonical form of the metric and the conformal structure of the foliating codimension-two-surfaces a gauge fixing, analogous to the one applied in arXiv:1409.4914, is introduced. In verifying that the true degrees of freedom of gravity may conveniently be represented by the conformal structure it is shown first that regardless whether the primary space is Riemannian or Lorentzian, in terms of the chosen geometrically distinguished new variables, the $1+n$ momentum constraint can be written as a first order symmetric hyperbolic system. It is also argued that in the generic case the Hamiltonian constraint can be solved as an algebraic equation. By combining the $1+n$ constraints with the part of the reduced system of the secondary $1+[n-1]$ decomposition that governs the evolution of the conformal structure---in the Riemannian case with an additional introduction of an imaginary `time'---a well-posed mixed hyperbolic-algebraic-hyperbolic system is formed. It is shown that regardless whether the primary space is of Riemannian or Lorentzian if a regular origin exists solutions to this system are also solutions to the full set of Einstein's equations. This, in particular, offers the possibility of developing a new method for solving Einstein's equations in the Riemannian case.

The well known geometric dragging of frames accelerates rotation but the hitherto unknown dynamic term, that reflects the disk structure, deccelerates rotation. The net result can diminish the Newtonian angular velocity of rotation in a central disk zone but the geometric dragging of frames dominates in the disk boundary zone.

    "abstract": "  The LIGO gravitational wave (GW) detectors will begin collecting data in 2015, with Virgo following shortly after. The use of squeezing has been proposed as a way to reduce the quantum noise without increasing the laser power, and has been successfully tested at one of the LIGO sites and at GEO in Germany. When used in Advanced LIGO without a filter cavity, the squeezer improves the performances of detectors above about 100 Hz, at the cost of a higher noise floor in the low frequency regime. Frequency-dependent squeezing, on the other hand, will lower the noise floor throughout the entire band. Squeezing technology will have a twofold impact: it will change the number of expected detections and it will impact the quality of parameter estimation for the detected signals. In this work we consider three different GW detector networks, each utilizing a different type of squeezer, all corresponding to plausible implementations. Using LALInference, a powerful Monte Carlo parameter estimation algorithm, we study how each of these networks estimates the parameters of GW signals emitted by compact binary systems, and compare the results with a baseline advanced LIGO-Virgo network. We find that, even in its simplest implementation, squeezing has a large positive impact: the sky error area of detected signals will shrink by about 30% on average, increasing the chances of finding an electromagnetic counterpart to the GW detection. Similarly, we find that the measurability of tidal deformability parameters for neutron stars in binaries increases by about 30%, which could aid in determining the equation of state of neutron stars. The degradation in the measurement of the chirp mass, as a result of the higher low-frequency noise, is shown to be negligible when compared to systematic errors. ",

Minimizing the number of templates required to cover the search parameter space, of sky position and frequency evolution, is one important way to reduce the computational cost of a search. We demonstrate a practical algorithm which, for the first time, achieves template placement with a minimal number of templates for an all-sky search, using the reduced supersky parameter-space metric of Wette and Prix [Phys. Rev. D 88, 123005 (2013)]. The metric prescribes a constant template density in the signal parameters, which permits that templates be placed at the vertices of a lattice. We demonstrate how to ensure complete coverage of the parameter space, including in particular at its boundaries. The number of templates generated by the algorithm is compared to theoretical estimates, and to previous predictions by Brady et al. [Phys. Rev. D 57, 2101 (1998)]. The algorithm may be applied to any search parameter space with a constant template density, which includes semicoherent searches and searches targeting known low-mass X-ray binaries. ",

Finally, by means of the corresponding Noether current, we integrate the equations of motion and obtain exact solutions for the scale factor, scalar and vector fields. It is shown that the resulting cosmology is an accelerated expansion universe for which its expansion is due to the presence of the vector field in the early times, while the scalar field is responsible of its late time expansion.

We describe this topology with a CW complex (a collection of two-cells glued together along edges), and use this to fix a gauge and reduce the Hamiltonian. The equations of motion for the fields describe a dynamical triangulation where each vertex moves according to the equation of motion for a free relativistic particle. The evolution is continuous except for when triangles collapse (i.e. the edges become parallel) causing discrete, topological changes in the underlying CW complex.   We then introduce the loop gravity phase space parameterized by holonomy-flux variables on a graph (a network of one-dimensional links). By embedding a graph within the CW complex, we find a description of this system in terms of loop variables. The resulting equations of motion describe the same dynamical triangulation as the connection and frame-field variables. In this framework, the collapse of a triangle causes a discrete change in the underlying graph, giving a concrete realization of the graph-changing moves that many expect to feature in full loop quantum gravity.

    "abstract": "  Gravitational waves from precessing black-hole binaries exhibit features that are absent in nonprecessing systems. The most prominent of these is a parity-violating asymmetry that beams energy and linear momentum preferentially along or opposite to the orbital angular momentum, leading to recoil of the binary. The asymmetry will appear as amplitude and phase modulations at the orbital frequency. For strongly precessing systems, it accounts for at least 3% amplitude modulation for binaries in the sensitivity band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, and can exceed 50% for massive systems. Such asymmetric features are also clearly visible when the waves are decomposed into modes of spin-weighted spherical harmonics, and are inherent in the waves themselves---rather than resulting from residual eccentricity in numerical simulations, or from mode-mixing due to precession. In particular, there is generically no instantaneous frame for which the mode decomposition will have any symmetry. We introduce a method to simplify the expressions for waveforms given in analytical relativity, which can be used to combine existing high-order waveforms for nonprecessing systems with expressions for the precessing contributions, leading to improved accuracy and a unified treatment of precessing and nonprecessing binaries. Using this method, it is possible to clarify the nature and the origins of the asymmetries and show the effects of asymmetry on recoils more clearly. We present post-Newtonian (PN) expressions for the waveform modes that include these terms, complete to the relative 2PN level in spin (proportional to $v^4/c^4$ times a certain combination of the spins). Comparing the results of those expressions to numerical results, we find good qualitative agreement. We also demonstrate how these expressions can be used to efficiently calculate waveforms for gravitational-wave astronomy. ",

These solutions are obtained with the advantage of higher curvature terms appearing in Lovelock gravity. We find that while the solution of third-order Lovelock gravity with constant-curvature horizon in the absence of a mass parameter is the anti de Sitter (AdS) metric, this kind of solution with nonconstant- curvature horizon is only asymptotically AdS and may have horizon. We also find that one may have an extreme black hole with non-constant curvature horizon whose Ricci scalar is zero or a positive constant, while there is no such black hole with constant-curvature horizon. Furthermore, the thermodynamics of the black holes in the two cases of constant- and nonconstant-curvature horizons are different drastically. Specially, we consider the thermodynamics of black holes with vanishing Ricci scalar and find that in contrast to the case of black holes of Lovelock gravity with constant-curvature horizon, the area law of entropy is not satisfied. Finally, we investigate the stability of these black holes both locally and globally and find that while the black holes with constant curvature horizons are stable both locally and globally, those with nonconstant-curvature horizons have unstable phases.

    "abstract": "  This paper examines the effect of the linear barotropic equation of state $p=\\omega\\rho$ on the existence or theoretical construction of traversable wormholes. If either the energy density or the closely related shape function is known, then the resulting redshift function $\\Phi$ will almost always lead to an event horizon. Specifying the redshift function avoids this problem but only by relinquishing some of the control over the physics. Moving to a cosmological setting, we assume that $\\Phi$ is such that $e^{2\\Phi}=[(r+a)/b_0]^l$, $a\\ge 0$, based on the existence of galactic rotation curves. Here the wormhole structure can only be maintained if $\\omega<-1$. This condition is independent of $l$. The scope of this model can therefore be extended to zero and negative $l$ by taking $l$ to be a convenient parameter that is not necessarily related to the tangential velocity. The main reason is that if $a=0$, then the two special cases $l=0$ and $l<0$ correspond to the only exactly solvable models for wormholes supported by phantom energy, while simultaneously avoiding an event horizon, thereby providing an additional motivation for the form of the redshift function. A final topic is a possible unification of these cases by means of teleparallel gravity. ",

In order to obtain the other Weyl scalars and the perturbed metric, a formalism was proposed by Chrzanowski and by Cohen and Kegeles (CCK) to construct these quantities in a radiation gauge via the Hertz potential. As a simple example of the construction of the perturbed gravitational field with this formalism, we consider the gravitational field produced by a rotating circular ring around a Schwarzschild black hole. In the CCK method, the metric is constructed in a radiation gauge via the Hertz potential, which is obtained from the solution of the Teukolsky equation. Since the solutions $\\psi_0$ and $\\psi_4$ of the Teukolsky equations are spin-2 quantities, the Hertz potential is determined up to its monopole and dipole modes. Without these lower modes, the constructed metric and Newman--Penrose Weyl scalars have unphysical jumps on the spherical surface at the radius of the ring. We find that the jumps of the imaginary parts of the Weyl scalars are cancelled when we add the angular momentum perturbation to the Hertz potential. Finally, by adding the mass perturbation and choosing the parameters which are related to the gauge freedom, we obtain the perturbed gravitational field which is smooth except on the equatorial plane outside the ring. We discuss the implication of these results to the problem of the computation of the gravitational self-force to the point particles in a radiation gauge. ",

We explore the use of such transmissive optical elements in extremely noise-sensitive environments such as the arm cavities of future gravitational-wave interferometers. This drives us to a geometry regime where radiative losses are no longer negligible. In this paper we derive the thermo-refractive noise associated with such radiative losses and compare it to other known sources of thermal noise. ",

In our solution, the spacetime is asymptotically AdS (anti-de Sitter), where the effective AdS curvature scale is determined solely by the derivative coupling constant. The metric approaches the AdS spacetime in the asymptotic infinity limit and precisely recovers the Schwarzschild-AdS solution in general relativity if the coupling constant is tuned to the inverse of the cosmological constant. We numerically find the lowest lying quasinormal frequency for the perturbation about a test massless, minimally coupled scalar field. The quasinormal frequency agrees with that of the Schwarzschild-AdS solution for the tuned case. For other parameters, in the large black hole limit, as the metric coincides with that of the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, the quasinormal frequency almost agrees with that of the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole and is insensitive to the value of the cosmological constant. On the other hand, for a small back hole the real part of the quasinormal frequency decreases as the absolute value of the cosmological constant increases. ",

    "abstract": "  This paper is mainly devoted to the determination of the travel time of a photon as a function of the positions of the emitter and the receiver in a large class of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. Such a function - often called time transfer function - is of crucial interest for testing metric theories of gravity in the solar system. Until very recently, this function was known only up to the second order in the Newtonian gravitational constant $G$ for a 3-parameter family of static, spherically symmetric metrics generalizing the Schwarzschild metric. We present here two procedures enabling to determine - at least in principle - the time transfer function at any order of approximation when the components of the metric are expressible in power series of the Schwarzschild radius of the central body divided by the radial coordinate. These procedures exclusively work for light rays which may be described as perturbations in power series in $G$ of a Minkowskian null geodesic passing through the positions of the emitter and the receiver. It is shown that the two methodologies lead to the same expression for the time transfer function up to the third order in $G$. The second procedure presents the advantage of exclusively needing elementary integrations which may be performed with any symbolic computer program whatever the order of approximation. The vector functions characterizing the direction of light propagation at the points of emission and reception are derived up to the third order in $G$. The relevance of the third order terms in the time transfer function is briefly discussed for some solar system experiments. ",

The strength of the interaction between matter and ELKO field is characterized by a constant parameter $\\beta$ and it is also assumed that both ELKO field as matter energy density are related to their pressures by equations of state parameters $\\omega_\\phi$ and $\\omega_m$, respectively.

The possibility of decay of ELKO field into dark matter or vice versa can be read directly from the tables, since the parameters $\\delta$ and $\\beta$ satisfy some inequalities.

    "abstract": "  The Lema\\^{\\i}tre -- Tolman model with $\\Lambda = 0$ and constant bang time that imitates the luminosity distance -- redshift relation of the $\\Lambda$CDM model using the energy function $E$ alone contains shell crossings. In this paper, the location in spacetime and the consequences of existence of the shell-crossing set (SCS) are investigated. The SCS would come into view of the central observer only at $t \\approx 1064 T$ to the future from now, where $T$ is the present age of the Universe, but would not leave any recognizable trace in her observations. Light rays emitted near to the SCS are blueshifted at the initial points, but the blueshift is finite, and is overcompensated by later-induced redshifts if the observer is sufficiently far. The local blueshifts cause that $z$ along a light ray is not a monotonic function of the comoving radial coordinate $r$. As a consequence, the angular diameter distance $D_A$ and the luminosity distance $D_L$ from the central observer fail to be functions of $z$; the relations $D_A(z)$ and $D_L(z)$ are multiple-valued in a vicinity of the SCS. The following quantities are calculated and displayed: (1) The distribution of mass density on a few characteristic hypersurfaces of constant time; some of them intersect the SCS. (2) The distribution of density along the past light cone of the present central observer. (3) A few light cones intersecting the SCS at characteristic instants.

    "abstract": "  We consider the self-force on a charged particle moving in a curved spacetime with a background electromagnetic field, extending previous studies to situations in which gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations are comparable. The formal expression $f^{ret}_\\alpha$ for the self-force on a particle, written in terms of the retarded perturbed fields, is divergent, and a renormalization is needed to find the particle's acceleration at linear order in its mass $m$ and charge $e$. We assume that, as in previous work in a Lorenz gauge, the renormalization for accelerated motion comprises an angle average and mass renormalization. Using the short distance expansion of the perturbed electromagnetic and gravitational fields, we show that the renormalization is equivalent to that obtained from a mode sum regularization in which one subtracts from the expression for the self-force in terms of the retarded fields a singular part field comprising only the leading and subleading terms in the mode sum. The most striking part of our result, arising from a remarkable cancellation, is that the renormalization involves no mixing of electromagnetic and gravitational fields. In particular, the renormalized mass is obtained by subtracting (1) the purely electromagnetic contribution from a point charge moving along an accelerated trajectory and (2) the purely gravitational contribution from a point mass moving along the same trajectory. In a mode-sum regularization, the same cancellation implies that the required regularization parameters are sums of their purely electromagnetic and gravitational values. ",

Here $B_{0}$ is a positive universal constant, $n$ is also a constant and $V$ is the volume of the fluid. From the consideration of thermodynamic stability, it is seen that only if the values of $n$ are allowed to be negative, then $(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V})_{S} <0$ throughout the evolution. Again thermal capacity at constant volume $c_{V}$ shows positive expression. Using the best fit value of $ n = -3.4$ as previously found by Guo \\emph{et al} \\cite{guo1} gives that the fluid is thermodynamically stable through out the evolution. The effective equation of state for the special case of, $n = 0$ goes to $\\Lambda$CDM model. Again for $n <0$ it favours phantom-like cosmology which is in agreement with the current SNe Ia constraints like VCG model. The deceleration parameter is also studied in the context of thermodynamics and the analysis shows that the \\emph{flip} occurs for the value of $ n < 4$. Finally the thermal equation of state is discussed which is an explicit function of temperature only. It is also observed that the third law of thermodynamics is satisfied in this model. As expected the volume increases as temperature falls during adiabatic expansions. In this case, for $ T \\rightarrow 0$, the thermal equation of state reduces to $(- 1 + \\frac{n}{6})$ which is identical with the equation of state for the case of large volume. ",

We analysed the EmU supported by two chiral cosmological fields for a spatially flat universe, while we have used three chiral fields when we investigated open and closed universes. To prove the validity of the EmU scenario we fixed the scale factor and found the exact solution by decomposition of EGB equations and solving the chiral field dynamics equation. To this end, we suggested the decomposition of the EGB equations in such a way that the first chiral field is responsible for the Einstein part of the model, while the second field, together with kinetic interaction term, is connected with the Gauss--Bonnet part of the theory. We proved that both fields are phantom ones under this decomposition, and that the model has a solution if the kinetic interaction between the fields equals a constant. We have presented the exact solution in terms of cosmic time. This was done for a spatially flat universe. In the case of open and closed universes we introduced the third chiral field (canonical for closed and phantom for open universe) which is responsible for the EGB and curvature parts. The solution of the third field equation is obtained in quadratures. Thus we have proved that the CCM is able to support EmU scenario in EGB gravity for spatially flat, open and closed universes. ",

    "abstract": "  (Abridged) High-order terms in the post-Newtonian (PN) expansions of various quantities for compact binaries exhibit a combinatorial increase in complexity, including ever-increasing numbers of transcendentals. Here we consider the gravitational wave energy flux at infinity from a point particle in a circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole, which is known to 22PN beyond the lowest-order Newtonian prediction, at which point each order has over 1000 terms. We introduce a factorization that considerably simplifies the spherical harmonic modes of the energy flux (and thus also the amplitudes of the spherical harmonic modes of the gravitational waves); it is likely that much of the complexity this factorization removes is due to curved-space wave propagation (e.g., tail effects). For the modes with azimuthal number l of 7 or greater, this factorization reduces the expressions for the modes that enter the 22PN total energy flux to pure integer PN series with rational coefficients, which amounts to a reduction of up to a factor of ~150 in the total number of terms in a given mode. The reduction in complexity becomes less dramatic for smaller l, due to the structure of the expansion, though the factorization is still able to remove all the half-integer PN terms. For the 22PN l = 2 modes, this factorization still reduces the total number of terms (and size) by a factor of ~10 and gives purely rational coefficients through 8PN. This factorization also improves the convergence of the series, though we find the exponential resummation introduced for the full energy flux by Isoyama et al. to be even more effective at improving the convergence of the individual modes, producing improvements of over four orders of magnitude over the original series for some modes. However, the exponential resummation is not as effective at simplifying the series, particularly for the higher-order modes. ",

The Casimir energy-momentum tensor is obtained (within the $\\mathbb{R}\\times S_2$ throat) by a mode sum approach, using a sharp energy cut-off and the Abel-Plana formula; Lorentz invariance is then restored by use of a Pauli-Villars regulator. The massless conformally-coupled case is found to have a logarithmic divergence (which we renormalise) and a conformal anomaly, the thermodynamic relevance of which is discussed. Provided the throat radius is above some fixed length, the renormalised Casimir energy-density is seen to be negative by all timelike observers, and almost all null rays; furthermore, it has sufficient magnitude to stabilise a long-throated wormhole far larger than the Planck scale, at least in principle. Unfortunately, the renormalised Casimir energy-density is zero for null rays directed exactly parallel to the throat, and this shortfall prevents us from stabilising the ultrastatic spherically-symmetric wormhole considered here. Nonetheless, the negative Casimir energy does allow the wormhole to collapse extremely slowly, its lifetime growing without bound as the throat-length is increased. We find that the throat closes slowly enough that its central region can be safely traversed by a pulse of light. ",

The basic constituents of the model are a special type of causal set (causet) called a $c$-causet. A $c$-causet is defined to be a causet that is independent of its labeling. We characterize $c$-causets as those causets that form a multipartite graph or equivalently those causets whose elements are comparable whenever their heights are different. We show that a $c$-causet has precisely two $c$-causet offspring. It follows that there are $2^n$ $c$-causets of cardinality $n+1$. This enables us to classify $c$-causets of cardinality $n+1$ in terms of $n$-bits. We then quantize the model by introducing a quantum sequential growth process. This is accomplished by replacing the $n$-bits by $n$-qubits and defining transition amplitudes for the growth transitions. We mainly consider two types of processes called stationary and completely stationary. We show that for stationary processes, the probability operators are tensor products of positive rank-1 qubit operators. Moreover, the converse of this result holds. Simplifications occur for completely stationary processes. We close with examples of precluded events. ",

Classically, the imposition of the two manifest local Killing fields of the BTZ geometry at the level of the full action results in a mini-superspace constraint action with the radial coordinate playing the role of the independent dynamical variable. The Noether symmetries of this reduced action are then shown to completely determine the classical solution space, without any further need to solve the dynamical equations of motion. At a quantum mechanical level, all the admissible sets of the quantum counterparts of the generators of the above mentioned symmetries are utilized as supplementary conditions acting on the wave-function. These additional restrictions, in conjunction with the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, help to determine (up to constants) the wave-function which is then treated semiclassically, in the sense of Bohm. The ensuing space-times are, either identical to the classical geometry, thus exhibiting a good correlation of the corresponding quantization to the classical theory, or are less symmetric but exhibit no Killing or event horizon and no curvature singularity, thus indicating a softening of the classical conical singularity of the BTZ geometry.

    "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider the problem of test particles and test scalar fields propagating on the background of a class of wormhole space-times. For test particles, we solve for arbitrary causal geodesics in terms of integrals which are solved numerically. These integrals are parametrized by the radius and shape of the wormhole throat as well as the initial conditions of the geodesic trajectory. In terms of these parameters, we compute the conditions for the geodesic to traverse the wormhole, to be reflected by the wormhole's potential or to be captured on an unstable bound orbit at the wormhole's throat. These causal geodesics are visualized by embedding plots in Euclidean space in cylindrical coordinates. For test scalar fields, we compute transmission coefficients and quasi-normal modes for arbitrary coupling of the field to the background geometry in the WKB approximation. We show that there always exists an unstable mode whenever the coupling constant is greater than 1/2. This analysis is interesting since recent computations of self-interactions of a static scalar field in wormhole space-times reveal some anomalous dependence on the coupling constant, principally, the existence of an infinite discrete set of poles. We show that this pathological behavior of the self-field is an artifact of computing the interaction for values of the coupling constant that do not lie in the domain of stability. ",

    "abstract": "  We investigate the properties of relativistic star spheres made of an electrically charged incompressible fluid, generalizing, thus, the Schwarzschild interior solution. The investigation is carried by integrating numerically the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, with the hypothesis that the charge distribution is proportional to the energy density. We match the interior to a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om exterior, and study some features of these star spheres such as the total mass $M$, the radius $R$, and the total charge $Q$. We also display the pressure profile. For star spheres made of a perfect fluid there is the Buchdahl bound, $R/M\\geq 9/4$, a compactness bound found from generic principles. For the Schwarzschild interior solution there is also the known compactness limit, the interior Schwarzschild limit where the configurations attain infinite central pressure, given by $R/M=9/4$, yielding an instance where the Buchdahl bound is saturated. We study this limit of infinite central pressure for the electrically charged stars and compare it with the Buchdahl-Andr\\'easson bound, a limit that, like the Buchdahl bound for the uncharged case, is obtained by imposing some generic physical conditions on charged configurations. We show that the electrical interior Schwarzschild limit of all but two configurations is always below the Buchdahl-Andr\\'easson limit, i.e., we find that the electrical interior Schwarzschild limit does not generically saturate the Buchdahl-Andr\\'easson bound. We also find that the quasiblack hole limit, i.e., the extremal most compact limit for charged incompressible stars, is reached when the matter is highly charged and the star's central pressure tends to infinity. This is one of the two instances where the Buchdahl-Andr\\'easson bound is saturated, the other being the uncharged, interior Schwarzschild solution. ",

Although a limitation of the FM has been well known, it is still mainly used due to its very low computational cost compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Recently, Rodriguez et al. [Phys. Rev. D 88, 084013 (2013)] performed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations for nonspinning binary systems with total masses $M \\leq 20 M_{\\odot}$, they found systematic differences between the predictions from FM and MCMC for $M>10 M_{\\odot}$. On the other hand, an effective Fisher matrix (eFM) was recently introduced by Cho et al. [Phys. Rev. D 87, 24004 (2013)]. The eFM is a semi-analytic approach to the standard FM, in which the partial derivative is taken by a quadratic fitting function to the local overlap surface. In this work, we apply the eFM method to several nonspinning binary systems and find that the error bounds in eFM are qualitatively in good agreement with the MCMC results of Rodriguez et al. in all mass regions. In particular, we provide concrete examples showing an importance of taking into account the template-dependent frequency cutoff of the inspiral waveforms. ",

We refer to the resulting system as ``fully covariant and conformal\", or fCCZ4 for short, since it is well suited for curvilinear as well as Cartesian coordinates. We implement this fCCZ4 formalism in spherical polar coordinates under the assumption of spherical symmetry using a partially-implicit Runge-Kutta (PIRK) method and show that our code can evolve both vacuum and non-vacuum spacetimes without encountering instabilities. Our method does not require regularization of the equations to handle coordinate singularities, nor does it depend on constraint-preserving outer boundary conditions, nor does it need any modifications of the equations for evolutions of black holes. We perform several tests and compare the performance of the fCCZ4 system, for different choices of certain free parameters, with that of BSSN. Confirming earlier results we find that, for an optimal choice of these parameters, and for neutron-star spacetimes, the violations of the Hamiltonian constraint can be between 1 and 3 orders of magnitude smaller in the fCCZ4 system than in the BSSN formulation. For black-hole spacetimes, on the other hand, any advantages of fCCZ4 over BSSN are less evident. ",

This indicates that a time-dependent stress along a certain direction results in a spacetime shift in that direction. For this model however, such material violates the null energy condition.

    "abstract": "  Several physical problems such as the `twin paradox' one in curved spacetimes have purely geometrical nature and are solved by studying properties of bundles of timelike geodesics. The problem of finding out the locally longest timelike curve is solvable in terms of Jacobi fields (the deviation vectors) and conjugate points. To this end we find complete solutions for Jacobi fields and conjugate points on radial and circular (if exist) timelike geodesics in a number of static spherically symmetric (SSS) spacetimes and, for comparison, in the spatially flat Robertson--Walker world. In spite of the common high symmetry the properties of the radial geodesics are in this respect considerably diverse. A generic theorem is that if an SSS spacetime admits stable circular timelike geodesics, then these curves contain three infinite sequences of conjugate points, which in some spacetimes may coincide, e.g. in CAdS space. Yet the global problem of determining the globally maximal timelike curve cannot be treated analytically by solving a differential equation. Globally maximal segments of timelike curves are found in the comoving coordinates and SSS spacetimes are preferred since for these metrics the transformation to these coordinates may be effectively constructed. In the case of radial geodesics with conjugate points it is possible to show by symmetry considerations that there are no cut points different from the conjugate ones (e.g. CAdS and Bertotti--Robinson spacetimes). In Reissner--Nordstr\\\"om spacetime the radial timelike geodesics are globally maximal outside the outer event horizon. ",

On the other hand, over the last decades, a systematic investigation of quantum corrections to the Newtonian potential has been carried out in the literature on quantum gravity. The present paper studies the effect of these tiny quantum corrections on the evaluation of equilibrium points. It is shown that, despite the extreme smallness of the corrections, there exists no choice of sign of these corrections for which all qualitative features of the restricted 3-body problem in Newtonian theory remain unaffected. Moreover, first-order stability of equilibrium points is characterized by solving a pair of algebraic equations of fifth degree, where some coefficients depend on the Planck length. The coordinates of stable equilibrium points are slightly changed with respect to Newtonian theory, because the planetoid is no longer at equal distance from the two bodies of large mass. The effect is conceptually interesting but too small to be observed, at least for the restricted 3-body problems available in the solar system. ",

This is manifested in a unified expression for the Compton wavelength and Schwarzschild radius. It is a natural consequence of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, which suggests corrections to the Uncertainty Principle as the energy increases towards the Planck value. It also entails corrections to the event horizon size as the black hole mass falls to the Planck value, leading to the concept of a Generalized Event Horizon. One implication of this is that there could be sub-Planckian black holes with a size of order their Compton wavelength. Loop quantum gravity suggests the existence of black holes with precisely this feature. The correspondence leads to a heuristic derivation of the black hole temperature and suggests how the Hawking formula is modified in the sub-Planckian regime. ",

Several independent studies have combined radar ranging and optical data from the last four decades to come to the conclusion that the astronomical unit is increasing by several meters per century. It is abundantly clear that General Relativity cannot account for this new effect, although an still undefined angular momentum transfer mechanism could provide the simpler and more conventional explanation. Here we investigate several anomalous post-newtonian terms containing only the product of the mass and angular momentum of the Sun as well as its Schwarzschild radius in order to determine if they could explain the secular increase of the astronomical unit and the recently reported increase of Lunar eccentricity. If these anomalies are confirmed, searching for a modification of General Relativity predicting these terms could have far-reaching consequences. ",

    "abstract": "  Laser frequency stabilization is a critical part of the interferometry measurement system of space-based gravitational wave observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Arm locking as a proposed frequency stabilization technique, transfers the stability of the long arm lengths to the laser frequency. The arm locking sensor synthesizes an adequately filtered linear combination of the inter-spacecraft phase measurements to estimate the laser frequency noise, which can be used to control the laser frequency. At the University of Florida we developed the hardware-based University of Florida LISA Interferometer Simulator (UFLIS) to study and verify laser frequency noise reduction and suppression techniques under realistic LISA-like conditions. These conditions include the variable Doppler shifts between the spacecraft, LISA-like signal travel times, optical transponders, realistic laser frequency and timing noise. We review the different types of arm locking sensors and discuss their expected performance in LISA. The presented results are supported by results obtained during experimental studies of arm locking under relevant LISA-like conditions. We measured the noise suppression as well as initial transients and frequency pulling in the presence of Doppler frequency errors. This work has demonstrated the validity and \\ feasibility of arm locking in LISA. ",

An infalling and a distant observer would have very different views on the structure of the world. However, a careful analysis has shown that it entails no genuine contradictions for physics, and the paradigm of observer complementarity has been coined. Recently this picture was put into doubt. In particular, it was argued that in old Black Holes a firewall must form in order to protect the basic principles of quantum mechanics. This AMPS paradox has already been discussed in a vast number of papers with different attitudes and conclusions. Here we want to argue that a possible source of confusion is neglection of quantum gravity effects. Contrary to widespread perception, it does not necessarily mean that effective field theory is inapplicable in rather smooth neighbourhoods of large Black Hole horizons. The real offender might be an attempt to consistently use it over the huge distances from the near-horizon zone of old Black Holes to the early radiation. We give simple estimates to support this viewpoint and show how the Page time and (somewhat more speculative) scrambling time do appear. ",

Purpose and scope of this paper is to explore the possibility to extend this finding to a general relativity context. For simplicity we restrict our consideration to the case of homogeneous and isotropic metrics and show that, via an approach analogous to that used for the nonrelativistic many-body problem, a class of homogeneous and isotropic cyclic solutions of Einstein's equations may be obtained. For these solutions the duration of the cycles does not depend on the initial conditions, so we call these models isochronous cosmologies. We give a physical interpretation of such metrics and in particular we show that they may behave arbitrarily closely, or even identically, to the Friedman-Robertson-Walker solutions of Einstein's equations for an arbitrarily long time (of course shorter than their period, which can also be assigned arbitrarily), so that they may reproduce all the satisfactory phenomenological features of the standard cosmological $\\Lambda $-CDM model in a portion of their cycle; while these isochronous cosmologies may be geodesically complete and therefore singularity-free.

We show the intimate relationships between those scalar fields that the three-dimensional system of k-essence can reduce to (phantom) tachyon, general non-canonical scalar field can reduce to (phantom) quintessence and k-essence can also reduce to (phantom) quintessence for some special cases. For the applications of the three-dimensional dynamical systems, we investigate several special cases and give the exactly dynamical solutions in detail. Furthermore, we proved that the dark energy density parameter $\\Omega_{\\phi}$ would obey the same differential equation not only for all the scalar models in this paper but also for all the non-coupled dark energy models under the GR frame. We therefore get the result that, if we want to find a dark energy phenomenological model which possesses a stable attractor corresponding to current universe with $\\Omega_{de}\\sim 0.70$ and $\\gamma_{de}\\sim 0.1$ to solve or at least alleviate the cosmological coincidence problem without fine-tunings, we must consider the interaction between dark energy and other barotropic fluids. This result is valid for not only all the non-coupled dark energy models, but also for many modified gravity models as long as the energy density and the pressure of dark energy (or effective dark energy) satisfies the continuity equation in Eq.(67). In the end of this paper, we also raise a question about the possibility of the chaotic behavior in the spatially flat single scalar field FRW cosmological models in the presence of ordinary matter.

In the present work we investigate scalar field cosmological models that can be obtained as solutions of the Riccati evolution equation for the Hubble function. Four exact integrability cases of the field equations are presented, representing classes of general solutions of the Riccati evolution equation. The solutions correspond to cosmological models in which the Hubble function is proportional to the scalar field potential plus a linearly decreasing function of time, models with the time variation of the scalar field potential proportional to the potential minus its square, models in which the potential is the sum of an arbitrary function and the square of the function integral, and models in which the potential is the sum of an arbitrary function and the derivative of its square root, respectively.

Our model uses a nonlinear material with a nonzero third order polarizability. Here a probe light pulse satisfies a wave equation containing the expectation value of the squared electric field. This expectation value depends upon the presence of lower frequency quanta, the background field, and modifies the effective index of refraction, and hence the speed of the probe pulse. If the mean squared electric field is positive, then the pulse is slowed, which is analogous to the gravitational effects of ordinary matter. Such matter satisfies the null energy condition and produce gravitational lensing and time delay. If the mean squared field is negative, then the pulse has a higher speed than in the absence of the background field. This is analogous to the gravitational effects of exotic matter, such as stress tensor expectation values with locally negative energy densities, which lead to repulsive gravitational effects, such as defocussing and time advance. We give some estimates of the magnitude of the effects in our model, and find that they may be large enough to be observable.

We focus on exact solutions to the equations for axion electrodynamics in the pp-wave gravitational background for two models with initially constant magnetic field. The first model describes the response of an initially constant magnetic field in a gravitational-wave vacuum with unit refraction index; the second model is characterized by a non-unit refraction index prescribed to the presence of ordinary and/or dark matter. We show that both models demonstrate anomalous behavior of the electromagnetic field generated by the axion-photon coupling in the presence of magnetic field, evolving in the gravitational wave background. The role of axionic dark matter in the formation of the anomalous response of this electrodynamic system is discussed. ",

    "abstract": "  A seismic array has been deployed at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in the former Homestake mine, South Dakota, to study the underground seismic environment. This includes exploring the advantages of constructing a third-generation gravitational-wave detector underground. A major noise source for these detectors would be Newtonian noise, which is induced by fluctuations in the local gravitational field. The hope is that a combination of a low-noise seismic environment and coherent noise subtraction using seismometers in the vicinity of the detector could suppress the Newtonian noise to below the projected noise floor for future gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper, we use Wiener filtering techniques to subtract coherent noise in a seismic array in the frequency band 0.05 -- 1\\,Hz. This achieves more than an order of magnitude noise cancellation over a majority of this band. We show how this subtraction would benefit proposed future low-frequency gravitational wave detectors. The variation in the Wiener filter coefficients over the course of the day, including how local activities impact the filter, is analyzed. We also study the variation in coefficients over the course of a month, showing the stability of the filter with time. How varying the filter order affects the subtraction performance is also explored. It is shown that optimizing filter order can significantly improve subtraction of seismic noise, which gives hope for future gravitational-wave detectors to address Newtonian noise. ",

However, one does not know a priori as to which of the two systems of equations should be used in a given situation, and the choice is dictated by experiments. It is expected that the Dirac equation holds for microscopic masses, and the Kerr solution for macroscopic masses. This suggests that Einstein gravity and the Dirac theory are limiting cases of a common underlying theoretical framework.

For the first time we are able to compare analytic estimates and strong field, nonlinear numerical calculations for this problem. As the black hole pierces through the cloud it accretes according to the Bondi-Hoyle prediction, but is deflected through a purely kinematic gravitational \"anti-Magnus\" effect, which we predict to be present also during the interaction of black holes with accretion disks. After the interaction is over, we find large recoil velocities in the transverse direction.

    "abstract": "  Symmetries play a crucial role in physics and, in particular, the Noether symmetries are a useful tool both to select models motivated at a fundamental level, and to find exact solutions for specific Lagrangians. In this work, we consider the application of point symmetries in the recently proposed metric-Palatini Hybrid Gravity in order to select the $f({\\cal R})$ functional form and to find analytical solutions for the field equations and for the related Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation. We show that, in order to find out integrable $f({\\cal R})$ models, conformal transformations in the Lagrangians are extremely useful. In this context, we explore two conformal transformations of the forms $d\\tau=N(a) dt$ and $d\\tau=N(\\phi) dt$. For the former conformal transformation, we found two cases of $f({\\cal R})$ functions where the field equations admit Noether symmetries. In the second case, the Lagrangian reduces to a Brans-Dicke-like theory with a general coupling function. For each case, it is possible to transform the field equations by using normal coordinates to simplify the dynamical system and to obtain exact solutions. Furthermore, we perform quantization and derive the WDW equation for the minisuperspace model. The Lie point symmetries for the WDW equation are determined and used to find invariant solutions. ",

Depending on the scale factor of the background, the resulting spacetime may contain black and white hole horizons, as well as other interesting boundary features. In order to further clarify the nature of these spacetimes, we address this question: do there exist bound particle and photon orbits in McVittie spacetimes? Considering first circular photon orbits, we obtain an explicit characterization of all McVittie spacetimes for which such orbits exist: there is a 2-parameter class of such spacetimes, and so the existence of a circular photon orbit is a highly specialised feature of a McVittie spacetime. However, we prove that in two large classes of McVittie spacetimes, there are bound particle and photon orbits: future-complete non-radial timelike and null geodesics along which the areal radius $r$ has a finite upper bound. These geodesics are asymptotic at large times to circular orbits of a corresponding Schwarzschild or Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. The existence of these geodesics lays the foundations for and shows the theoretical possibility of the formation of accretion disks in McVittie spacetimes. We also summarize and extend some previous results on the global structure of McVittie spacetimes. The results on bound orbits are established using centre manifold and other techniques from the theory of dynamical systems. ",

Here we extend previous results on the semiclassical properties of quantum polyhedra. Regarding tetrahedra, we compare the results from a canonical quantization of the classical system with a recent wave function based approach to the large-volume sector of the quantum system. Both methods agree in the leading order of the resulting effective operator (given by an harmonic oscillator), while minor differences occur in higher corrections. Perturbative inclusion of such corrections improves the approximation to the eigenstates. Moreover, the comparison of both methods leads also to a full wave function description of the eigenstates of the (square of the) volume operator at negative eigenvalues of large modulus.   For the case of general quantum polyhedra described by discrete angular momentum quantum numbers we formulate a set of quantum operators fulfilling in the semiclassical regime the standard commutation relations between momentum and position. Differently from previous formulations, the position variable here is chosen to have dimension of (Planck) length squared which facilitates the identification of quantum corrections. Finally, we provide expressions for the pentahedral volume in terms of Kapovich-Millson variables. ",

In the case of point-like massive sources in the $T\\times T\\times T$ model, we demonstrate that the gravitational potential has no definite values on the straight lines joining identical masses in neighboring cells, i.e. at points where masses are absent. Clearly, this is a nonphysical result since the dynamics of cosmic bodies is not determined in such a case. The only way to avoid this problem and get a regular solution at any point of the cell is the smearing of these masses over some region. Therefore, the smearing of gravitating bodies in $N$-body simulations is not only a technical method but also a physically substantiated procedure. In the cases of $\\; T\\times T\\times R\\; $ and $\\; T\\times R\\times R$ topologies, there is no way to get any physically reasonable and nontrivial solution. The only solutions we can get here are the ones which reduce these topologies to the $T\\times T\\times T$ one. ",

    "abstract": "  We present a phenomenological model for baryogenesis based on particle creation in the Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime. This study is a continuation of our proposal that Hawking-like radiation in FRW space-time explains several physical aspects of the early Universe including inflation. In this model we study a coupling between the FRW space-time, in the form of the derivative of the Ricci scalar, and the $B-L$ current, $J^{\\mu} _{B-L}$, which leads to a different chemical potential between baryons and anti-baryons resulting in an excess of baryons over anti-baryons with the right order of magnitude. In this model the generation of baryon asymmetry, in principle, occurs over the entire history of the Universe starting from the beginning of the radiation phase. However, in practice, almost the entire contribution to the baryon asymmetry only comes from the very beginning of the Universe and is negligible thereafter. There is a free parameter in our model which can be interpreted as defining the boundary between the unknown quantum gravity regime and the inflation/baryogenesis regime covered by our model. When this parameter is adjusted to give the observed value of baryon asymmetry we get a higher than usual energy scale for our inflation model which however may be in line with the GUT scale for inflation in view of the BICEP2 and Planck results. In addition our model provides the correct temperature for the CMB photons at the time of decoupling. ",

We discuss this relationship and how the topological structure of the fields is related to the Robinson congruence. Since the topology appears in the lines of force for both electromagnetism and gravity, the gravito-electromagnetic formalism is used to analyze the gravitational hopfions and describe the time evolution of their tendex and vortex lines. The correspondence between fields of different spin results in analogous configurations based on the same topological structure. The null and type N fields propagate at the speed of light, while the non-null and type D fields radiate energy outward from the center.

The main new feature is the emission of gravitational waves into the bulk. We study two classes of solutions: First, if the compact dimension is stabilized, the waves vanish and one exactly recovers DGP cosmology. However, a stabilization by means of physical matter is not possible for a tension-dominated brane, thus implying a late time modification of 4D cosmology different from DGP. Second, for a freely expanding compact direction, we find exact attractor solutions with zero 4D Hubble parameter despite the presence of a 4D cosmological constant. The model hence constitutes an explicit example of dynamical degravitation at the full non-linear level. Without stabilization, however, there is no 4D regime and the model is ruled out observationally, as we demonstrate explicitly by comparing to supernova data. ",

The linearized regime features a vertex displacement (`diffeomorphism') symmetry for which we derive an abelian constraint algebra. This permits to identify gauge invariant `lattice gravitons' as propagating curvature degrees of freedom. The Pachner moves admit a simple method to explicitly count the gauge and `graviton' degrees of freedom on an evolving triangulated hypersurface and we clarify the distinct role of each move in the dynamics. It is shown that the 1-4 move generates four `lapse and shift' variables and four conjugate vertex displacement generators; the 2-3 move generates a `graviton'; the 3-2 move removes one `graviton' and produces the only non-trivial equation of motion; and the 4-1 move removes four `lapse and shift' variables and trivializes the four conjugate symmetry generators. It is further shown that the Pachner moves preserve the vertex displacement generators. These results may provide new impetus for exploring `graviton dynamics' in discrete quantum gravity models. ",

    "abstract": "  In General Relativity, cosmic strings are well known to produce a static, locally flat spacetime with a wedge removed. If the tension exceeds a critical value, the deficit angle becomes larger than $ 2\\pi $, leading to a compact exterior that ends in a conical singularity. In this work, we investigate dynamical solutions for cosmic strings with super-critical tensions. To this end, we model the string as a cylindrical shell of finite and stabilized transverse width and show that there is a marginally super-critical regime in which the stabilization can be achieved by physically reasonable matter.   We show numerically that the static deficit angle solution is unstable for super-critical string tensions. Instead, the geometry starts expanding in axial direction at an asymptotically constant rate, and a horizon is formed in the exterior, which has the shape of a growing cigar. We are able to find the analytic form of the attractor solution describing the interior of the cosmic string. In particular, this enables us to analytically derive the relation between the string tension and the axial expansion rate. Furthermore, we show that the exterior conical singularity can be avoided for dynamical solutions.   Our results might be relevant for theories with two extra dimensions, modeling our universe as a cosmic string with a three-dimensional axis. We derive the corresponding Friedmann equation, relating the on-brane Hubble parameter to the string tension or, equivalently, brane cosmological constant. ",

For R^n gravity, we show that for n different from 2, the initial conditions in the radiation dominated era are the same as those found in General Relativity. We also find that by doing simulations which involve either modifying the background evolution while keeping the perturbation equations fixed or fixing the background to be the Lambda-CDM model and modifying the perturbation equations, the dominant contribution to deviations from General Relativity in the temperature and polarization spectra can be attributed to modifications in the background. This demonstrates the importance of using the correct background in perturbative studies of f(R) gravity.

Owing to the specific functional form of the matter bounce Hubble parameter, the reconstruction technique leads, after some simplifications, to the same Hubble parameter as in the matter bounce scenario. Focusing the study to the large and small cosmic time $t$ limits, we were able to find which $F(R)$ gravities can generate the matter bounce Hubble parameter. In the case of small cosmic time limit, which corresponds to large curvature values, the $F(R)$ gravity is $F(R)\\sim R+\\alpha R^2$, which is an inflation generating gravity, and at small curvature, or equivalently, large cosmic time, the $F(R)$ gravity generating the corresponding limit of the matter bounce Hubble parameter, is $F(R)\\sim \\frac{1}{R}$, a gravity known to produce late-time acceleration. Thus we have the physically appealing picture in which a Jordan frame $F(R)$ gravity that imitates the matter bounce solution at large and small curvatures, can generate Starobinsky inflation and late-time acceleration. Moreover, the scale factor corresponding to the reconstruction technique coincides almost completely to the matter bounce scenario scale factor, when considered in the aforementioned limiting curvature cases. This is scrutinized in detail, in order to examine the validity of the reconstruction method in these limiting cases, and according to our analysis, exact agreement is achieved. ",

    "abstract": "  The gravitational waveforms in the ghost-free bigravity theory exhibit deviations from those in general relativity. The main difference is caused by graviton oscillations in the bigravity theory. We investigate the prospects for the detection of the corrections to gravitational waveforms from coalescing compact binaries due to graviton oscillations and for constraining bigravity parameters with the gravitational wave observations. We consider the bigravity model discussed by the De Felice-Nakamura-Tanaka subset of the bigravity model, and the phenomenological model in which the bigravity parameters are treated as independent variables. In both models, the bigravity waveform shows strong amplitude modulation, and there can be a characteristic frequency of the largest peak of the amplitude, which depends on the bigravity parameters. We show that there is a detectable region of the bigravity parameters for the advanced ground-based laser interferometers, such as Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA. This region corresponds to the effective graviton mass of $\\mu \\geq 10^{-17}~{\\rm cm}^{-1}$ for $\\tilde{c}-1 \\geq 10^{-19}$ in the phenomenological model, while $\\mu \\geq 10^{-16.5}~{\\rm cm}^{-1}$ for $\\kappa\\xi_c^2 \\geq 10^{0.5}$ in the De Felice-Nakamura-Tanaka subset of the bigravity model, respectively, where $\\tilde{c}$ is the propagation speed of the massive graviton and $\\kappa\\xi_c^2$ corresponds to the corrections to the gravitational constant in general relativity. These regions are not excluded by existing solar system tests. We also show that, in the case of $1.4-1.4M_{\\rm sun}$ binaries at the distance of $200~{\\rm Mpc}$, $\\log\\mu^2$ is determined with an accuracy of ${\\cal O}$(0.1)\\% at the 1$\\sigma$ level for a fiducial model with $\\mu^2=10^{-33}~{\\rm cm}^{-2}$ in the case of the phenomenological model.

We use the solutions of the hydrodynamical equations for dark energy in the gravitational fields of such objects for cases of static distribution of dark energy in the vicinity of star and stationary accretion onto black hole in order to analyze the possibility of constraining of the parameters of dark energy from astrophysical data. We show that dependence of density of dark energy in the vicinity of such object on the effective sound speed, background density and equation of state parameter of dark energy makes it possible to try such tests.

Most of the analysis regarding the collapse hypothesis has been solely focused on the characteristics of the spectrum associated to scalar perturbations, and within a semiclassical gravity framework.

The physical quantities of the solution are calculated, and a local Smarr-like relation on the black hole horizon is derived. It possesses the same form as the Smarr-like relation for the asymptotically flat Myers-Perry black hole. It is demonstrated that in contrast to the asymptotically flat Myers-Perry black hole, the ratio of the horizon angular momentum and the mass $J^2/ M^3$ is unbounded, and can grow arbitrarily large. We study the properties of the ergoregion and the horizon surface. The external field does not influence the horizon topology.

If the secondary has a low mass, the black hole spin cannot change too much even if the black hole swallows the whole stellar companion. If the secondary has a high mass, its lifetime is too short to transfer the necessary amount of matter and spin the black hole up. However, while black holes formed from the collapse of a massive star with Solar metallicity are expected to have low birth spin, current spin measurements show that some black holes in X-ray binaries are rotating very rapidly. Here I show that, if these objects are not the Kerr black holes of general relativity, the accretion of a small amount of matter ($\\sim 2$~$M_\\odot$) can make them look like very fast-rotating Kerr black holes. Such a possibility is not in contradiction with any observation and it can explain current spin measurements in a very simple way. ",

Moreover, we show that it is also very difficult if not impossible to construct a non-linear model which is ghost-free within the framework of bimetric variational formalism. However, we demonstrate that viable models are possible along similar lines of thought. To this end, we consider a set up in which the affine connection is a variation of the Levi-Civita one. As a proof of principle we construct a gravity model with a massless scalar field obtained this way. ",

    "abstract": "  In this paper, we have studied $F(R,T)$ gravity as an arbitrary function of curvature and torsion scalars in Friedmann--Lema\\^{\\i}tre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) background. Then, we have considered interacting model between $F(R,T)$ gravity and modified Chaplygin gas. The novelty of this model is that the Universe includes both cases curvature and torsion, and one dominated by a Chaplygin gas. In order to calculate cosmological solutions, we obtained Friedmann equations and also equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy. By employing interacting model we considered the total energy density and the total pressure of Universe as the combination of components of dark energy and Chaplygin gas. Subsequently, we reconstructed the model by an origin of a scalar field entitled quintessence model with a field potential. The field potential has been calculated in terms of free parameters of $F(R,T)$ gravity and modified Chaplygin gas. In what follows, we used a parametrization, and the cosmological parameters have been written in terms of redshift $z$. Next, we plotted cosmological parameters with respect to three variable of cosmic time, redshift $z$ and $e$-folding number $N=ln(a)$, and the figures showed us an accelerated expansion of Universe. Also, we have described the scenario in three status early time, late time and future time by $e$-folding number. Finally, the stability of scenario has been investigated by a useful function named sound speed, and the graph of sound speed versus $e$-folding number has been showed us that there is the stability in late time.

    "abstract": "  As is well known, one can explain the current cosmic acceleration by considering an inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic universe (which violates the cosmological principle), without invoking dark energy or modified gravity. The well-known one of this kind of models is the so-called Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) void model, in which the universe is spherically symmetric and radially inhomogeneous, and we are living in a locally underdense void centered nearby our location. In the present work, we test various LTB void models with some old high redshift objects (OHROs). Obviously, the universe cannot be younger than its constituents. We find that an unusually large $r_0$ (characterizing the size of the void) is required to accommodate these OHROs in LTB void models. There is a serious tension between this unusually large $r_0$ and the much smaller $r_0$ inferred from other observations (e.g. SNIa, CMB and so on). However, if we instead consider the lowest limit 1.7\\,Gyr for the quasar APM 08279+5255 at redshift $z=3.91$, this tension could be greatly alleviated. ",

    "abstract": "  Friedmann-Lemaitre equations with contributions coming from matter, curvature, cosmological constant, and radiation, when written in terms of conformal time u rather than in terms of cosmic time t, can be solved explicitly in terms of standard Weierstrass elliptic functions. The spatial scale factor, the temperature, the densities, the Hubble function, and almost all quantities of cosmological interest (with the exception of t itself) are elliptic functions of u, in particular they are bi-periodic with respect to a lattice of the complex plane, when one takes u complex. After recalling the basics of the theory, we use these explicit expressions, as well as the experimental constraints on the present values of density parameters (we choose for the curvature density a small value in agreement with experimental bounds) to display the evolution of the main cosmological quantities for one real period 2 omega_r of conformal time (the cosmic time t never end but it goes to infinity for a finite value u_f < 2 omega_r of u). A given history of the universe, specified by the measured values of present-day densities, is associated with a lattice in the complex plane, or with an elliptic curve, and therefore with two Weierstrass invariants g2, g3. Using the same experimental data we calculate the values of these invariants, as well as the associated modular parameter and the corresponding Klein j-invariant. If one takes the flat case k=0, the lattice is only defined up to homotheties, and if one, moreover, neglects the radiation contribution, the j-invariant vanishes and the corresponding modular parameter tau can be chosen in one corner of the standard fundamental domain of the modular group (equihanharmonic case: tau = exp(2 i pi/3)). Several exact, ie non-numerical, results of independent interest are obtained in that case. ",

    "abstract": "  The recent background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization (BICEP2) observations are believed as an evidence for the cosmic inflation. BICEP2 provided a first direct evidence for the inflation, determined its energy scale and debriefed witnesses for the quantum gravitational processes. The ratio of scalar-to-tensor fluctuations $r$ which is the canonical measurement of the gravitational waves, was estimated as $r=0.2_{-0.05}^{+0.07}$. Apparently, this value agrees well with the upper bound value corresponding to PLANCK $r\\leq 0.012$ and to WMAP9 experiment $r=0.2$. It is believed that the existence of a minimal length is one of the greatest predictions leading to modifications in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle or a GUP at the Planck scale. In the present work, we investigate the possibility of interpreting recent BICEP2 observations through quantum gravity or GUP. We estimate the slow-roll parameters, the tensorial and the scalar density fluctuations which are characterized by the scalar field $\\phi$. Taking into account the background (matter and radiation) energy density, $\\phi$ is assumed to interact with the gravity and with itself. We first review the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe and then suggest modification in the Friedmann equation due to GUP. By using a single potential for a chaotic inflation model, various inflationary parameters are estimated and compared with the PLANCK and BICEP2 observations. While GUP is conjectured to break down the expansion of the early Universe (Hubble parameter and scale factor), two inflation potentials based on certain minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model result in $r$ and spectral index matching well with the observations. Corresponding to BICEP2 observations, our estimation for $r$ depends on the inflation potential and the scalar field. A power-law inflation potential does not. ",

    "abstract": "  The late time accelerated expansion of the Universe demands that even in local galactic-scales it is desirable to study astrophysical phenomena, particularly relativistic accretion related phenomena in massive galaxies or in galaxy mergers and the dynamics of the kiloparsecs-scale structure and beyond, in the local-galaxies in Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SDS) background, rather than in Schwarzschild or Newtonian paradigm. Owing to the complex and nonlinear character of the underlying magnetohydrodynamical equations in general relativistic (GR) regime, it is quite useful to have an Newtonian analogous potential containing all the important GR features that allows to treat the problem in Newtonian framework for study of accretion and its related processes. From the principle of conserved Hamiltonian of the test particle motion, here, a three dimensional Newtonian analogous potential has been obtained in spherical geometry corresponding to SDS/Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter (SADS) spacetime, that reproduces almost all of the GR features in its entirety with remarkable accuracy. The derived potential contains an explicit velocity dependent term of the test particle that renders an approximate relativistic modification of Newtonian like potential. The complete orbital dynamics around SDS geometry and the epicyclic frequency corresponding to SDS metric have been extensively studied in the Newtonian framework using the derived potential. Applying the derived analogous potential it is found that the current accepted value of $\\Lambda \\sim 10^{-56} \\rm cm^{-2}$ moderately influences both sonic radius as well as Bondi accretion rate, especially for spherical accretion with smaller values of adiabatic constant and temperature, which might have interesting consequences on the stability of accretion disk in AGNs/radio galaxies.

    "abstract": "  Previously, we had proposed a gravitational wave detector that incorporates the white light cavity (WLC) effect using a compound cavity for signal recycling (CC-SR). Here, we first calculate the quantum noise (QN) limited sensitivity curves for this design, and find that the broadening of sensitivity predicted by the classical analysis is also present in these curves, but is somewhat reduced. Furthermore, we find that the curves always stay above the standard quantum limit (SQL). To circumvent this limitation, we modify the dispersion to compensate the non-linear phase variation produced by the opto-mechanical (OM) resonance effects by making use of the single sideband approximation (SSA). We find that the resonance dips in the resulting QN curves entail a 14 times higher sensitivity-bandwidth product compared to the highest sensitivity result presented by Bunanno and Chen. We also present a simpler scheme (WLC-SR) where a dispersion medium is inserted in the SR cavity. Compared to the highest sensitivity result of Bunanno and Chen, the QN exhibits an enhancement of sensitivity-bandwidth product by a factor of 18. We consider both positive and negative dispersion for phase compensation. For the negative dispersion, we consider a narrow band dip on top of a broadband gain. For the positive dispersion, we consider a narrow transparency on top of a broad absorption. For the negative dispersion, we show that, for the parameters that yield net enhancement in the sensitivity-bandwidth product, lasing does not occur. ",

In addition to cosmic microwave background detectors, efforts are underway to carry out gravitational-wave astronomy over a wide range of frequencies including pulsar timing arrays (nHz), space-based detectors (mHz), and terrestrial detectors ($\\sim$10-2000 Hz). This multiband effort will probe a wide range of times in the early Universe (each corresponding to a different energy scale), during which gravitational-wave backgrounds may have been produced through processes such as phase transitions or preheating. In this letter, we derive a rule of thumb (not quite so strong as an upper limit) governing the maximum energy density of cosmological backgrounds.

Both of these measures, particularly the first, are closely related to those used to assess the homogeneity of our own universe on the basis of galaxy redshift surveys. I employ these measures to quantify the quantum spacetime homogeneity as well as the temporal evolution of quantum spatial homogeneity of ensembles of causal triangulations in the well-known physical phase. According to these measures, the quantum spacetime geometry exhibits some degree of inhomogeneity on sufficiently small scales and a high degree of homogeneity on sufficiently large scales. This inhomogeneity appears unrelated to the phenomenon of dynamical dimensional reduction.

This last contribution is going to be characterised by the LISA Pathfinder mission, a technology precursor of future space-borne detectors like eLISA. Changing the perspective from displacement to acceleration can benefit the data analysis of LISA Pathfinder and future detectors. The response in differential acceleration to gravitational waves is derived for a space-based detector's interferometric link. The acceleration formalism can also be integrated into time delay interferometry by building up the unequal-arm Michelson differential acceleration combination. The differential acceleration is nominally insensitive to the system free evolution dominating the slow displacement dynamics of low-frequency detectors. Working with acceleration also provides an effective way to subtract measured signals acting as systematics, including the actuation forces. Because of the strong similarity with the equations of motion, the optimal subtraction of systematic signals, known within some amplitude and time shift, with the focus on measuring the noise provides an effective way to solve the problem and marginalise over nuisance parameters. The $\\mathcal{F}$-statistic, in widespread use throughout the gravitation waves community, is included in the method and suitably generalised to marginalise over linear parameters and noise at the same time. The method is applied to LPF simulator data and, thanks to its generality, can also be applied to the data reduction and analysis of future gravitational wave detectors. ",

The naked singularity case presents a very structured non-connected set of regions of orbital stability, where the presence of counterrotating particles and zero angular momentum particles for a specific class of naked singularities is interpreted as due to the presence of a repulsive field generated by the central source of gravity. In particular, we analyze the effects of the dynamical structure of the ergoregion (the union of the orbital regions for different attractor spins) on the behavior of accretion disks around the central source. The properties of the circular motion turn out to be so distinctive that they allow the introduction of a complete classification of Kerr spacetimes, each class of which is characterized by different physical effects that could be of especial relevance in observational Astrophysics.

The first part of this thesis is devoted to the presentation of asymptotic methods (symmetries, solution space and surface charges) applied to gravity in the case of the BMS gauge in three and four spacetime dimensions. The second part of this thesis contains the original contributions. Firstly, it is shown that the enhancement from Lorentz to Virasoro algebra also occurs for asymptotically flat spacetimes defined in the sense of Newman-Unti. As a first application, the transformation laws of the Newman-Penrose coefficients characterizing solution space of the Newman-Unti approach are worked out, focusing on the inhomogeneous terms that contain the information about central extensions of the theory. These transformations laws make the conformal structure particularly transparent, and constitute the main original result of the thesis. Secondly, asymptotic symmetries of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system with or without cosmological constant are explicitly worked out in a unified manner in $d$ dimensions. In agreement with a recent conjecture, a Virasoro-Kac-Moody type algebra is found not only in three dimensions but also in the four dimensional asymptotically flat case.

    "abstract": "  We study the acceleration of an electric current-carrying and axially-symmetric string loop initially oscillating in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field. The plane of the string loop is orthogonal to the magnetic field lines and the acceleration of the string loop occurs due to the transmutation effect turning in the deep gravitational field the internal energy of the oscillating strings to the energy of their translational motion along the axis given by the symmetry of the black hole spacetime and the magnetic field. We restrict our attention to the motion of string loop with energy high enough, when it can overcome the gravitational attraction and escape to infinity. We demonstrate that for the current-carrying string loop the transmutation effect is enhanced by the contribution of the interaction between the electric current of the string loop and the external magnetic field and we give conditions that have to be fulfilled for an efficient acceleration. The Schwarzschild black hole combined with the strong external magnetic field can accelerate the current-carrying string loop up to the velocities close to the speed of light $v \\sim c$. Therefore, the string loop transmutation effect can potentially well serve as an explanation for acceleration of highly relativistic jets observed in microquasars and active galactic nuclei. ",

    "abstract": "  We investigate effect of a test magnetic field on the process of destroying near-extremal Kerr black hole with a charged test particle. It has been shown that it would be possible to throw a charged test particle into the near extremal rotating black hole and make it go past the extremality i.e. turn Kerr black hole into the Kerr-Newmann naked singularity. Typically in an astrophysical scenario black holes are believed to be surrounded by a magnetic field. Magnetic field although small, affects motion of charged particles drastically due to the large Lorentz force, as the electromagnetic force is much stronger that the gravity. Thus a test magnetic field can affect the process of destroying black holes and restore the cosmic censorship in the astrophysical context. We show that a test magnetic field would act as a cosmic censor beyond a certain threshold value. We try to gauge the magnitude of the magnetic field by comparing its energy density with that of the change in the curvature induced by the test particle. We find that the magnetic field required in only as strong as or slightly stronger as compared to the value for which its effect of the background geometry is comparable to the tiny backreaction as that of the test particle. In such a case however one has to take take into account effect of the magnetic field on the background geometry, which is difficult to implement in the absence of any exact near-extremal rotating magnetized black hole solutions. We argue that magnetic field would still act as a cosmic censor. ",

Generically, they describe composite configurations with several individual components, possesing a nonzero magnetic charge, even in the absence of a Higgs field. Such Yang-Mills configurations exist already in the probe limit, the AdS geometry supplying the attractive force needed to balance the repulsive force of Yang-Mills gauge interactions. The gravitating solutions are constructed by numerically solving the elliptic Einstein-DeTurck--Yang-Mills equations. The variation of the gravitational coupling constant $\\alpha$ reveals the existence of two branches of gravitating solutions which bifurcate at some critical value of $\\alpha$. The lower energy branch connects to the solutions in the global AdS spacetime, while the upper branch is linked to the generalized Bartnik-McKinnon solutions in asymptotically flat spacetime.

For the low energy quantum gravity effective models which respect covariance of the curved spacetime, we derive the deformed model-independent KG/Dirac and Hamilton-Jacobi equations using the methods of effective field theory. We then find that, to all orders of the effective theories, the deformed Hamilton-Jacobi equations can be obtained from the original ones by simply replacing the mass of emitted particles $m$ with a parameter $m_{eff}$ that includes all the quantum gravity corrections. Therefore, in this scenario, there will be no corrections to the Hawking temperature of a black hole from the quantum gravity effects if its original Hawking temperature is independent of the mass of emitted particles. As a consequence, our results show that breaking covariance in quantum gravity effective models is a key for a black hole to have the remnant left in the evaporation. ",

    "abstract": "  In the early 1970s it is was realized that there is a striking formal analogy between the Laws of black-hole mechanics and the Laws of classical thermodynamics. Before the discovery of Hawking radiation, however, it was generally thought that the analogy was only formal, and did not reflect a deep connection between gravitational and thermodynamical phenomena. It is still commonly held that the surface gravity of a stationary black hole can be construed as a true physical temperature and its area as a true entropy only when quantum effects are taken into account; in the context of classical general relativity alone, one cannot cogently construe them so. Does the use of quantum field theory in curved spacetime offer the only hope for taking the analogy seriously? I think the answer is `no'. To attempt to justify that answer, I shall begin by arguing that the standard argument to the contrary is not physically well founded, and in any event begs the question. Looking at the various ways that the ideas of \"temperature\" and \"entropy\" enter classical thermodynamics then will suggest arguments that, I claim, show the analogy between classical black-hole mechanics and classical thermodynamics should be taken more seriously, without the need to rely on or invoke quantum mechanics. In particular, I construct an analogue of a Carnot cycle in which a black hole \"couples\" with an ordinary thermodynamical system in such a way that its surface gravity plays the role of temperature and its area that of entropy. Thus, the connection between classical general relativity and classical thermodynamics on their own is already deep and physically significant, independent of quantum mechanics. ",

We study Choptuik scaling, a phenomenon which relates the initial conditions of a matter distribution to the final observables of small black holes.   In both higher dimensional general relativity and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity we confirm the existence of cusps in the mass scaling relation which had previously only been observed in four dimensional general relativity.

For the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet case we find that the self-similar behaviour seen in the general relativistic case is destroyed. We find that it is replaced by some other form of scaling structure. In five dimensions we find that the period of the critical solution at the origin is proportional to roughly the cube root of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter and that there is evidence for a minimum black hole radius. In six dimensions we see evidence for a new type of scaling. We also show, from the equations of motion, that there is reason to expect qualitative differences between five and higher dimensions. ",

Solutions of the second type correspond to the isotropic pressure tensor; in particular, we discuss the exact solution, for which the dark energy is characterized by the equation of state for a string gas. Solutions of the third type describe the dark energy model with constant pressure and energy density. For the solutions of the third type, we consider in detail the problem of horizons and find constraints for the parameters of nonminimal coupling and for the constitutive parameters of the dark energy equation of state, which guarantee that the nonminimal wormholes are traversable.

The precession rate increases again and after that it falls obeying the general inverse cube law of distance. This anomaly is maximum at the polar region of this spacetime and it vanishes after crossing a certain `critical' angle towards equator from pole.

The existence of a $C^1$ extension across the horizon implies that there is no $C^{N + 2}$ extension across the horizon if some components of $N$-th covariant derivative of Riemann tensor diverge at the horizon in the coordinates of the $C^1$ extension. In particular, the divergence of a component of the Riemann tensor at the horizon directly indicates the presence of a curvature singularity. By using this method, we can confirm the existence of a curvature singularity for several cases where the scalar invariants constructed from the Riemann tensor, e.g., the Ricci scalar and the Kretschmann invariant, take finite values at the horizon. As a concrete example of the application, we show that the Kaluza-Klein black holes constructed by Myers have a curvature singularity at the horizon if the spacetime dimension is higher than five. ",

Only the monopole moment of the matter source is responsible for the late-time tail of the Green's functions.

The repulsion radius determines a physical region, which can be interpreted as a repulsion sphere, where the effects due to repulsive gravity naturally arise. Further, we show that the use of effective masses to characterize repulsive regions can lead to coordinate-dependent results whereas, in our approach, repulsion emerges as a consequence of the spacetime geometry in a completely invariant way. Our definition is tested in the spacetime of an electrically charged Kerr naked singularity and in all its limiting cases. We show that a positive mass can generate repulsive gravity if it is equipped with an electric charge or an angular momentum. We obtain reasonable results for the spacetime regions contained inside the repulsion sphere whose size and shape depend on the value of the mass, charge and angular momentum. Consequently, we define repulsive gravity as a classical relativistic effect by using the geometry of spacetime only. ",

    "abstract": "  We investigate the Weyl tensor algebraic structure of a fully general family of D-dimensional geometries that admit a non-twisting and shear-free null vector field k. From the coordinate components of the curvature tensor we explicitly derive all Weyl scalars of various boost weights. This enables us to give a complete algebraic classification of the metrics in the case when the optically privileged null direction k is a (multiple) Weyl aligned null direction (WAND). No field equations are applied, so that the results are valid not only in Einstein's gravity, including its extension to higher dimensions, but also in any metric gravitation theory that admits non-twisting and shear-free spacetimes.   We prove that all such geometries are of type I(b), or more special, and we derive surprisingly simple necessary and sufficient conditions under which k is a double, triple or quadruple WAND. All possible algebraically special types, including the refinement to subtypes, are thus identified, namely II(a), II(b), II(c), II(d), III(a), III(b), N, O, IIi, IIIi, D, D(a), D(b), D(c), D(d), and their combinations. Some conditions are identically satisfied in four dimensions.   We discuss both important subclasses, namely the Kundt family of geometries with the vanishing expansion (Theta=0) and the Robinson-Trautman family (Theta\\not=0, and in particular Theta=1/r). Finally, we apply Einstein's field equations and obtain a classification of all Robinson-Trautman vacuum spacetimes. This reveals fundamental algebraic differences in the D>4 and D=4 cases, namely that in higher dimensions there only exist such spacetimes of types D(a)=D(abd), D(c)=D(bcd) and O. ",

We show that by excavating meter-scale recesses in the ground around the main test masses of a gravitational wave detector it is possible to reduce the coupling of Rayleigh wave driven seismic disturbances to test mass displacement. A discussion of the optimal recess shape is given and we use finite element simulations to derive the scaling of the Newtonian noise suppression with the parameters of the recess as well as the frequency of the seismic excitation. Considering an interferometer similar to an Advance LIGO configuration, our simulations indicate a frequency dependent Newtonian noise suppression factor of 2 to 4 in the relevant frequency range for a recesses of 4m depth and a width and length of 11m and 5m, respectively. Though a retrofit to existing interferometers seems not impossible, the application of our concept to future infrastructures seems to provide a better benefit/cost ratio and therefore a higher feasibility.

The analogue particle moves in the potential well under the action of the internal force produced by the curvature of space, matter, and pressures of classical and quantum gravitational sources. At a definite stage of the evolution of the universe, this force can perform the positive work on the universe, which is similar to the work of the repulsive forces of dark energy, or it does the negative work analogous to the work of the attractive forces of dark matter.

We also provide a complete dictionary between gravitational and thermodynamical variables. In the non-viscous cases there are three thermodynamic equations which characterise a bubble dynamics: These are the first law, the Marangoni flow equation and the Young-Laplace equation. In all three equations the surface tension plays a central role: In the first law it appears as a work term per unit area, in the Marangoni flow its gradient drives a force, and in the Young-Laplace equation it contributes to a pressure proportional to the surface curvature. The gravity equations appear as a natural generalization of these bubble equations when the bubble itself is viscous and dynamical. In particular, it shows that the mechanism of entropy production for the viscous bubble is mapped onto the production of gravitational waves. We also review the relationship between surface tension and temperature, and discuss the usual black-hole thermodynamics from this point of view. ",

Results indicate that circular Schwarzschild geodesics of radius $r_0>6m$ are stable under small uniform accelerations along the orbital plane. These stable orbits undergo small oscillations around $r_0$, behaving like a harmonic oscillator driven by a periodic force plus another constant force. Circular orbits with axis parallel to the direction of black hole acceleration are also considered. In this case an algebraic relation expressing the condition of stability is obtained.

Previous searches for gravitational waves from neutron stars have focused on the detection of individual neutron stars, which are either nearby or highly non-spherical. Here we consider the stochastic gravitational-wave signal arising from the ensemble of Galactic neutron stars. Using a population synthesis model, we estimate the single-sigma sensitivity of current and planned gravitational-wave observatories to average neutron star ellipticity $\\epsilon$ as a function of the number of in-band Galactic neutron stars $N_\\text{tot}$. For the plausible case of $N_\\text{tot}\\approx 53000$, and assuming one year of observation time with colocated initial LIGO detectors, we find it to be $\\sigma_\\epsilon=2.1\\times10^{-7}$, which is comparable to current bounds on some nearby neutron stars. (The current best $95\\%$ upper limits are $\\epsilon\\lesssim7\\times10^{-8}.$) It is unclear if Advanced LIGO can significantly improve on this sensitivity using spatially separated detectors. For the proposed Einstein Telescope, we estimate that $\\sigma\\epsilon=5.6\\times10^{-10}$. Finally, we show that stochastic measurements can be combined with measurements of individual neutron stars in order to estimate the number of in-band Galactic neutron stars. In this way, measurements of stochastic gravitational waves provide a complementary tool for studying Galactic neutron stars. ",

    "abstract": "  Since the discovery of Hawking radiation, its consistency with quantum theory has been widely questioned. In the widely described picture, irrespective of what initial state a black hole starts with before collapsing, it eventually evolves into a thermal state of Hawking radiations after the black hole is exhausted. This scenario violates the principle of unitarity as required for quantum mechanics and leads to the acclaimed \"information loss paradox\". This paradox has become an obstacle or a reversed touchstone for any possible theory to unify the gravity and quantum mechanics. Based on the results from Hawking radiation as tunneling, we recently show that Hawking radiations can carry off all information about the collapsed matter in a black hole. After discovering the existence of information-carrying correlation, we show in great detail that entropy is conserved for Hawking radiation based on standard probability theory and statistics. We claim that information previously considered lost remains hidden inside Hawking radiation. More specifically, it is encoded into correlations between Hawking radiations. Our study thus establishes harmony between Harking radiation and the unitarity of quantum mechanics, which establishes the basis for a significant milestone towards resolving the long-standing information loss paradox. The paper provides a brief review of the exciting development on Hawking raidation. In addition to summarize our own work on this subject, we compare and address other related studies. ",

In $3+1$ dimensional vacuum spacetimes there is three-fold infinity of freedom in constructing such theories as revealed by the presence of three arbitrary $g_{\\theta\\theta}$ dependent functions in the Hamiltonian (matter Hamiltonian also has the corresponding freedom). This result is not a contradiction to the theorem of Hojman et. al.

In the full theory where there are no special symmetries, the result of Hojman et. al. will continue to hold. In the process we also show that theories where the constraint algebra is deformed by the presence of $g_{\\theta\\theta}$ dependent functions - as is the case in the presence of inverse triad corrections in loop quantum gravity - can always be brought to the form where they obey the standard (undeformed) constraint algebra by performing a suitable canonical transformation.

By assuming the radiation as an optimization process, we discuss its effect on time evolution of rotating (charged and uncharged) black holes. For uncharged rotating black holes evaporating under the maximum mutual information optimization, their scale invariant rotation parameter $a_*=a/M$ is almost constant at the early stage but rapidly increase at the very last stage of the evaluation process. The value of rotation parameter at the final state of evaporation depends on the initial condition of the black hole. We also found that the presence of electric charge can cause the black holes lose their angular momentum more rapidly than they lose mass. The charged-rotating black holes asymptotically approach a state which is described by $a_*= 0$ and $Q/M = 1$. ",

Such ringings, which are moreover slowly decaying, are directly constructed from the retarded Green function. If we describe the source of the black hole perturbation by an initial value problem with Gaussian initial data, i.e., if we consider the excitation of the black hole from an extrinsic point of view, we can show that these extraordinary ringings are still present. This suggests that physically realistic sources of perturbations should generate giant and slowly decaying ringings and that their existence could be used to constrain ultralight bosonic field theory interacting with black holes.

In the Boulware state, both the energy density and flux are negative divergent when the observer is dropped at the horizon, and asymptotically vanish.

The flux in the Unruh state is always positive and divergent at the horizon.

In the case of explicit breaking it is known that conflicts can arise between the dynamics and geometrical constraints, while spontaneous breaking evades this problem. It is for this reason that in the gravity sector of the Standard-Model Extension (SME) it is assumed that the background fields (SME coefficients) originate from spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in other examples, such as Chern-Simons gravity and massive gravity, diffeomorphism invariance is explicitly broken by the background fields, and the potential conflicts between the dynamics and geometry can be avoided in most cases. An analysis of how this occurs is given, and the conditions that are placed on the metric tensor and gravitational structure as a result of the presence of an explicit-breaking background are described. The gravity sector of the SME is then considered for the case of explicit breaking. However, it is found that a useful post-Newtonian limit is only obtained when the symmetry breaking is spontaneous.

A covariant symmetrized energy-momentum tensor is constructed in a general form. ",

Moreover, there existed some shortcomings in the previous derivation of geodesic equations. Different from the massless case, they used a different approach to derive the geodesic equation of the massive particles. Even the treatment was inconsistent with the variation principle of action. To remedy the shortcoming, we improve treatment to deduce the geodesic equations of massive and massless particles in a unified and self-consistent way.

We solve numerically the coupled system of equations formed by the Einstein and the Klein-Gordon equations under the assumption of spherical symmetry using spherical coordinates. Our results confirm the existence of oscillating, long-lived, self-gravitating scalar fields configurations around non-rotating black holes in highly dynamical spacetimes with a rich scalar field environment. Our numerical simulations are long-term stable and allow for the extraction of the resonant frequencies to make a direct comparison with results obtained in the linearized regime. A byproduct of our simulations is the existence of a degeneracy in plausible long-lived solutions of Einstein equations that would induce the same motion of test particles, either with or without the existence of quasi-bound states.

    "abstract": "  We classify wormholes endowed with redshift effects and finite mass into three types. Type (1) wormholes have their radial pressure dying out faster, as one moves away from the throat, than any other component of the stress-energy and thus violate the least the local energy conditions. We introduce a novel and generalizable method for deriving, with no cutoff in the stress-energy or gluing, the three types of wormholes. We focus on type (1) wormholes and construct different asymptotically flat solutions with finite, upper- and lower-bounded, mass $M$. It is observed that the radial pressure is negative, and the null energy condition is violated, only inside a narrow shell, adjacent to the throat, of relative spacial extent $\\epsilon$. Reducing the relative size of the shell, without harming the condition of traversability, yields an inverse square law of $\\epsilon$ versus $M$ for supermassive wormholes. We show that the diameter of the shadow of this type (1) supermassive wormhole overlaps with that of the black hole candidate at the center of the Milky Way and that the recent derivation, using the up-to-date millimeter-wavelength very long baseline interferometry made in Astrophys. J. \\textbf{795} 134 (2014) [arXiv:1409.4690], remains inconclusive.   We show that redshift-free wormholes, with positive energy density, have one of their barotropic equations of state in the phantom regime, have their stress energy tensor traceless, and are anisotropic. They are all type (3) wormholes having their variable equations of state approaching 1 and $-1$ at spatial infinity. We also introduce a new approach for deriving new redshift-free wormholes. ",

The various cases for which the resulting systems of equations can be solved are identified.

    "abstract": "  Hartle's model describes the equilibrium configuration of a rotating isolated compact body in perturbation theory up to second order in General Relativity. The interior of the body is a perfect fluid with a barotropic equation of state, no convective motions and rigid rotation. That interior is matched across its surface to an asymptotically flat vacuum exterior. Perturbations are taken to second order around a static and spherically symmetric background configuration. Apart from the explicit assumptions, the perturbed configuration is constructed upon some implicit premises, in particular the continuity of the functions describing the perturbation in terms of some background radial coordinate. In this work we revisit the model within a modern general and consistent theory of perturbative matchings to second order, which is independent of the coordinates and gauges used to describe the two regions to be joined. We explore the matching conditions up to second order in full. The main particular result we present is that the radial function $m_0$ (in the setting of the original work) of the second order perturbation tensor, contrary to the original assumption, presents a jump at the surface of the star, which is proportional to the value of the energy density of the background configuration there. As a consequence, the change in mass needed by the perturbed configuration to keep the value of the central energy density unchanged must be amended. We also discuss some subtleties that arise when studying the deformation of the star. ",

    "abstract": "  Macroscopic concepts pertaining to the Unruh effect are elaborated and used to clarify its physical manifestations. Based on a description of the motion of accelerated, spatially extended laboratories in Minkowski space in terms of Poincar\\'e transformations, it is shown that, from a macroscopic perspective, an accelerated observer will not register with his measuring instruments any global thermal effects of acceleration in the inertial (Minkowskian) vacuum state. As is explained, this result is not in conflict with the well-known fact that microscopic probes respond non-trivially to acceleration if coupled to the vacuum. But this response cannot be interpreted as the effect of some heat bath surrounding the observer. It is also shown that genuine equilibrium states in a uniformly accelerated laboratory cannot be spatially homogeneous. In particular, these states coincide with the homogeneous inertial vacuum at sufficiently large distances from the horizon of the observer and consequently have the same (zero) temperature there. The analysis is carried out in the theory of a free massless scalar field; however the conclusion that the Unruh effect is not of a thermal nature, viz. induced by heat transfer, is generally valid.

These calculations are then expanded to the critical behavior of Born-Infeld-AdS (BI-AdS) black holes in the third order of Lovelock gravity and in the grand canonical ensemble to find a Van der Waals behavior for $d=7$ and a reentrant phase transition for $d=8$ for specific values of potential $\\phi$ in the grand canonical ensemble.

While most binaries are expected to possess circular orbits, some may be eccentric, for example, if they are formed through dynamical capture. Eccentric orbits can create difficulty for matched filtering searches due to the challenges of creating effective template banks to detect these signals. In previous work, we showed how seedless clustering can be used to detect low-mass ($M_\\text{total}\\leq10M_\\odot$) compact binary coalescences for both spinning and eccentric systems, assuming a circular post-Newtonian expansion. Here, we describe a parameterization that is designed to maximize sensitivity to low-eccentricity ($0\\leq\\epsilon\\leq0.6$) systems, derived from the analytic equations. We show that this parameterization provides a robust and computationally efficient method for detecting eccentric low-mass compact binaries. Based on these results, we conclude that advanced detectors will have a chance of detecting eccentric binaries if optimistic models prove true. However, a null observation is unlikely to firmly rule out models of eccentric binary populations. ",

We consider simulations of merging black holes with equal masses $M$ and initial spin angular momenta aligned with the orbital angular momentum, including new simulations with spin magnitudes up to $S/M^2 = 0.994$. We measure the area and (using approximate Killing vectors) the spin on the individual and common apparent horizons, finding that the inequality $8\\pi S < A$ is satisfied in all cases but is very close to equality on the common apparent horizon at the instant it first appears. We also introduce a gauge-invariant lower bound on the extremality by computing the smallest value that Booth and Fairhurst's extremality parameter can take for any scaling. Using this lower bound, we conclude that the common horizons are at least moderately close to extremal just after they appear. Finally, following Lovelace et al. (2008), we construct quasiequilibrium binary-black-hole initial data with \"overspun\" marginally trapped surfaces with $8\\pi S > A$ and for which our lower bound on their Booth-Fairhurst extremality exceeds unity. These superextremal surfaces are always surrounded by marginally outer trapped surfaces (i.e., by apparent horizons) with $8\\pi S<A$. The extremality lower bound on the enclosing apparent horizon is always less than unity but can exceed the value for an extremal Kerr black hole. (Abstract abbreviated.) ",

    "abstract": "  The inclusion of aligned-spin effects in gravitational-wave search pipelines for neutron-star--black-hole binary coalescence has been shown to increase the astrophysical reach with respect to search methods where spins are neglected completely, under astrophysically reasonable assumptions about black-hole spins. However, theoretical considerations and population synthesis models suggest that many of these binaries may have a significant misalignment between the black-hole spin and the orbital angular momentum, which could lead to precession of the orbital plane during the inspiral and a consequent loss in detection efficiency if precession is ignored. This work explores the effect of spin misalignment on a search pipeline that completely neglects spin effects and on a recently-developed pipeline that only includes aligned-spin effects. Using synthetic but realistic data, which could reasonably represent the first scientific runs of advanced-LIGO detectors, the relative sensitivities of both pipelines are shown for different assumptions about black-hole spin magnitude and alignment with the orbital angular momentum. Despite the inclusion of aligned-spin effects, the loss in signal-to-noise ratio due to precession can be as large as $40\\%$, but this has a limited impact on the overall detection rate: even if precession is a predominant feature of neutron-star--black-hole binaries, an aligned-spin search pipeline can still detect at least half of the signals compared to an idealized generic precessing search pipeline.

In order to achieve this, an interaction between dark energy and dark matter is considered. A set-up is designed and a constraint equation is obtained which generates the f(G) models that do not suffer from the coincidence problem. Due to the absence of a universally accepted interaction term introduced by a fundamental theory, the study is conducted over three different forms of logically chosen interaction terms. To illustrate the set-up three widely known models of f(G) gravity are taken into consideration and the problem is studied under the designed set-up. The study reveals that the popular f(G) gravity models does not approve of a satisfactory solution of the long standing coincidence problem, thus proving to be a major setback for them as successful models of universe. Finally, two non-conventional models of f(G) gravity have been proposed and studied in the framework of the designed set-up. It is seen that a complete solution of the coincidence problem is achieved for these models. The study also reveals that the b-interaction term is much more preferable compared to the other interactions, due to its greater compliance with the recent observational data. ",

    "abstract": "  We derive the scalar waveform generated by a binary of nonspinning compact objects (black holes or neutron stars) in a general class of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. The waveform is accurate to 1.5 post-Newtonian order [$O((v/c)^3)$] beyond the leading-order tensor gravitational waves (the \"Newtonian quadrupole\"). To solve the scalar-tensor field equations, we adapt the direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations formalism developed by Will, Wiseman, and Pati. The internal gravity of the compact objects is treated with an approach developed by Eardley. We find that the scalar waves are described by the same small set of parameters which describes the equations of motion and tensor waves. For black hole--black hole binaries, the scalar waveform vanishes, as expected from previous results which show that these systems in scalar-tensor theory are indistinguishable from their general relativistic counterparts. For black hole--neutron star binaries, the scalar waveform simplifies considerably from the generic case, essentially depending on only a single parameter up to first post-Newtonian order. With both the tensor and scalar waveforms in hand, we calculate the total energy flux carried by the outgoing waves. This quantity is computed to first post-Newtonian order relative to the \"quadrupole formula\" and agrees with previous, lower order calculations. ",

Phantom is characterized by the fact that it possesses negative momentum and kinetic energy and that it gives large negative pressure which acts as antigravity. We consider phantom harmonic oscillator in comparison to a standard harmonic oscillator. By using the first law of thermodynamics we explain why the energy density of the Universe grows when it is filled with phantom. We also show how the collision of phantom with a standard particle leads to exploration of energy from the former by the latter (i.e. from phantom to the standard) if their masses are different. The most striking of our conclusions is that the collision of phantom and standard particles of the same masses is impossible unless both of them are at rest and suddenly start moving with the opposite velocities and kinetic energies. This effect is a classic analogue of a quantum mechanical particle pair creation in a strong electric field or in physical vacuum. ",

    "abstract": "  With the advance in computational resources, Bayesian inference is increasingly becoming the standard tool of practise in GW astronomy. However, algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) require a large number of iterations to guarantee convergence to the target density. Each chain demands a large number of evaluations of the likelihood function, and in the case of a Hessian MCMC, calculations of the Fisher information matrix for use as a proposal distribution. As each iteration requires the generation of at least one gravitational waveform, we very quickly reach a point of exclusion for current Bayesian algorithms, especially for low mass systems where the length of the waveforms is large and the waveform generation time is on the order of seconds. This suddenly demands a timescale of many weeks for a single MCMC. As each likelihood and Fisher information matrix calculation requires the evaluation of noise-weighted scalar products, we demonstrate that by using the linearity of integration, and the fact that more than 90% of the generation time is spent at frequencies less that one third of the maximum, we can construct composite integrals that speed up the MCMCs for comparable mass binaries by a factor of between 3.5 and 5.5, depending on the waveform length. This method is both source and detector type independent, and can be applied to any waveform that displays significant frequency evolution, such as stellar mass binaries with Advanced LIGO/Virgo, as well as supermassive black holes with eLISA ",

This new code carefully maintains high precision to allow us to obtain high-accuracy solutions for the gravitational quasinormal modes of the Kerr space-time. Part of this new code is an implementation of a spectral method for solving the angular Teukolsky equation that, to our knowledge, has not been used before for determining quasinormal modes. We focus our attention on two main areas. First, we explore the behavior of these quasinormal modes in the extreme limit of Kerr, where the frequency of certain modes approaches accumulation points on the real axis. We compare our results with recent analytic predictions of the behavior of these modes near the accumulation points and find good agreement. Second, we explore the behavior of solutions of modes that approach the special frequency $M\\omega=-2i$ in the Schwarzschild limit. Our high-accuracy methods allow us to more closely approach the Schwarzschild limit than was possible with previous numerical studies. Unlike previous work, we find excellent agreement with analytic predictions of the behavior near this special frequency. We include a detailed description of our methods, and make use of the theory of confluent Heun differential equations throughout. In particular, we make use of confluent Heun polynomials to help shed some light on the controversy of the existence, or not, of quasinormal and total-transmission modes at certain special frequencies in the Schwarzschild limit.

    "abstract": "  In this assignment we try to probe the role played by torsion in the current scenario of coincidence and devise a set-up for its realization. In order to model the scenario, the energy arising from the torsion component is considered analogous to dark energy. An interaction between dark energy and dark matter is considered, which is by far the best possible tool to realize the coincidence. A set-up is designed and a constraint equation is obtained which screens the models of \\textit{f(T)} gravity that can successfully accommodate the stationary scenario in its framework, from those which cannot. Due to the absence of a universally accepted interaction term introduced by a fundamental theory, the study is conducted over three different forms of chosen interaction terms. As an illustration two widely known models of \\textit{f(T)} gravity are taken into consideration and used in the designed setup. The study reveals that the realization of the coincidence scenario as well as the role played by torsion in the current universe is a model dependent phenomenon. It is found that the first model showed a considerable departure from the stationary scenario. On the contrary the other four models are perfectly consistent with our setup and generated a satisfactory stationary scenario, thus showing their cosmological viability and their superiority over their counterparts. For the third model (exponential model) it was seen that the cosmological coincidence is realized only in the phantom regime. For the fourth (logarithmic model) and the fifth models, we see that the the stationary scenario is attained for negative interaction values. This shows that the direction of flow must be from dark energy to dark matter unlike the previous models. Under such circumstances the universe will return from the present energy dominated phase to a matter dominated phase. ",

By adapting a mechanism previously formulated in order to describe the confinement of massive tests particles in a domain wall (that simulates classically the trapping of the Dirac field in a domain wall), we study the influence of the brane thickness on the four-dimensional (4D) path of massless particles. Although the geometry is not warped and, therefore, the bound motion in the transverse direction is not decoupled from the movement in the 4D-world, we can find an explicit solution for the light deflection and the time delay, if the motion in the fifth direction is a high frequency oscillation. We verify that, owing to the transverse motion, the light deflection and the time delay depend on the energy of the light rays. This feature may lead to the phenomenon of gravitational rainbow.

For the case of $Q_+'$, we are able to solve for the discrete solutions and the exact quantum squeezed states. ",

We determine new extreme black hole solutions that generalize the Nariai horizon to asymptotically de Sitter-like solutions for any order relation between the squares of the charge $q^2$ and the mass parameter $M^2$ provided $q^2$ remains smaller than some limit, which is larger than $M^2$. In the limit case $q^2=9\\omega^2 M^2/(9\\omega^2-1)$, we derive the general expression of the extreme cosmo-black-hole, where the three horizons merge, and discuss some of its properties. We also show that the endpoint of the evaporation process is independent of any order relation between $q^2$ and $M^2$. The Teitelboim's energy and Padmanabhan's energy are related by a nonlinear expression and are shown to correspond to different ensembles. We also determine the enthalpy $H$ of the event horizon, as well as the effective thermodynamic volume which is the conjugate variable of the negative quintessential pressure, and show that in general the mass parameter and the Teitelboim's energy are different from the enthalpy and internal energy; only in the cosmological case, that is, for Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-de Sitter black hole we have $H=M$. Generalized Smarr formulas are also derived. It is concluded that the internal energy has a universal expression for all static charged black holes, with possibly a variable mass parameter, but it is not a suitable thermodynamic potential for static-black-hole thermodynamics if $M$ is constant. It is also shown that the Reverse Isoperimetric Inequality holds. We generalize the results to the case of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-de Sitter black hole surrounded by quintessence with two physical constants yielding two thermodynamic volumes. ",

The class of black holes studied is necessarily singular in general relativity. We derive a tetrad which is compatible with the black hole interior and utilize this tetrad in the gravitational equations of motion to study the black hole interior. It is shown that in the case where the gravitational Lagrangian is expandable in a power series $f(T)=T+\\underset{n\\neq 1}{\\sum} b_{n}T^{n}$ that black holes can be non-singular while respecting certain energy conditions in the matter fields. Thus the black hole singularity may be removed and the gravitational equations of motion can remain valid throughout the manifold.

Hence, gravitational $f(T)$ Lagrangians which are Taylor expandable in powers of $T$ may yield regular black holes of this type. Although it is found that these black holes can be rendered non-singular in $f(T)$ theory, we conjecture that a mild singularity theorem holds in that the dominant energy condition is violated in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the general relativity singular point if the corresponding $f(T)$ black hole is regular.

We address the question using a model in which secondary simplicity constraints arise from a dynamical preservation of the primary ones, and answer it in the affirmative. The origin of the extra condition is to be found in the different graph localisations of the various constraints. Our results are consistent with previous claims by Dittrich and Ryan, and extend their validity to Lorentzian signature and a priori arbitrary cellular decompositions. Finally, we show how the (gauge-invariant version of the) twist angle {\\xi} featuring in twisted geometries equals on-shell the Regge dihedral angle multiplied by the Immirzi parameter, thus recovering the discrete extrinsic geometry from the Ashtekar-Barbero holonomy.

In particular, former assumptions referring to the existence of quantum boxes, the exact differential of the entropy variation and the role of the boundary can be omitted. Moreover, the open problem of the quantum occupation number per box is solved. Thus, the arguments in favour of MIQG become even more stringent. The remaining assumptions are 1. the principle of optimisation of the resulting per imposed degrees of freedom, 2. abstract quantum number conservation, 3. the validity of the laws of thermodynamics, 4. identification of a macroscopic parameterisation with space-time and 5. unspecific interactions. Although the requirements are reduced, all former results remain valid. In particular, all well established physics as special cases (Quantum Field Theory, QFT, and General Relativity, GR) follow and all measurable quantities may be computed. ",

Two different profiles of the associated radiation flux are considered in comparison, corresponding to either constant or oscillating electric and magnetic fields with respect to a natural family of observers. These are the most common situations to be experimentally explored, and have a well known counterpart in the flat spacetime limit. The resulting line elements are determined by a single metric function, which turns out to be expressed in terms of standard trigonometric functions in the case of a constant radiation flux, and in terms of special functions in the case of oscillating flux, leading to different features of test particle motion. The world line deviation between both uncharged and charged particles on different spacetime trajectories due to the combined effect of gravitational and electromagnetic forces is studied. The interaction of charged particles with the background radiation field is also discussed through a general relativistic description of the inverse Compton effect. Motion as well as deviation effects on particles endowed with spin are studied too. Special situations may occur in which the direction of the spin vector change during the interaction, leading to obsevables effects like spin-flip. ",

    "abstract": "  The notion of \"reference frame\" is a central theoretical construct for interpreting the physical implications of spacetime diffeomorphism invariance in General Relativity. However, the alternative formulation of classical General Relativity known as Shape Dynamics suggest that a subset of spacetime diffeomorphisms - namely hypersurface deformations - are, in a certain sense, dual to spatial conformal (or Weyl) invariance. Moreover, holographic gauge/gravity dualities suggest that bulk spacetime diffeomorphism invariance can be replaced by the properties of boundary CFTs. How can these new frameworks be compatible with the traditional notion of reference frame so fundamental to our interpretation of General Relativity? In this paper, we address this question by investigating the classical case of maximally symmetric spacetimes with a positive cosmological constant. We find that it is possible to define a notion of \"Shape Observer\" that represents a conformal reference frame that is dual to the notion of inertial reference frame in spacetime. We then provide a precise dictionary relating the two notions. These Shape Observers are holographic in the sense that they are defined on the asymptotic conformal boundaries of spacetime but know about bulk physics. This leads to a first principles derivation of an exact classical holographic correspondence that can easily be generalized to more complicated situations and may lead to insights regarding the interpretation of the conformal invariance manifest in Shape Dynamics.

A form of the Strong Equivalence Principle for unified electrogravity is first formulated, and it immediately leads to (i) the empirical Schuster-Blackett law relating the magnetic moments and angular momenta of neutral astronomical bodies, (ii) an analogous relation between the linear acceleration of neutral massive bodies and associated electric fields, (iii) gravitational lensing in excess of Einstein gravity, and, with the additional assumption of scaling, to (iv) the Wesson relation between the angular momentum and the square of the mass of astronomical bodies. Incorporation of Sciama's version of Mach's principle leads to a new post-Newtonian dynamics (in the weak field limit of gravity alone without electromagnetism) that predicts flat rotation curves of galaxies without the need of dark matter haloes. Finally, it is shown that the unified theory with a broken symmetry predicts a flat expanding universe with a cosmological term intimately related to electrogravity unification, and can explain WMAP data with a single free parameter. WMAP data require $\\rho_q =6.1\\times 10^{-43}$ C/cc which is too small to be detected at ",

We consider the classical interaction of an extremal Kerr black hole with a test massless Dirac field, i.e. a \"neutrino field\". Evaluating the flux integrals imposed by the energy momentum tensor for fermionic fields and the Killing vectors of the space-time, we prove that this interaction can indeed destroy the event horizon of the black hole and convert it to a naked singularity. The classical process leads to a more generic violation of cosmic censorship conjecture compared to quantum tunnelling processes which occur with a low probability. The range of frequencies of the test neutrino field that can be used to destroy the black hole turns out to be the superradiant range for bosonic fields. We comment on back reaction and quantum effects. We argue that the destruction of black holes by neutrino fields cannot be fixed by self-force effects unlike similar attempts involving test bodies and bosonic fields. ",

In this context, we study here an analogue gravity system based on a relativistic Bose--Einstein condensate. We show that in a suitable limit this system provides not only an example of an emergent spacetime (with a massive and a massless relativistic fields propagating on it) but also that such spacetime is governed by an equation with geometric meaning that takes the familiar form of Nordstr{\\\"o}m theory of gravitation. In this equation the gravitational field is sourced by the expectation value of the trace of the effective stress energy tensor of the quasiparticles while the Newton and cosmological constants are functions of the fundamental scales of the microscopic system.

We use the framework of quasi-local horizons and identify a black hole by marginally outer trapped surfaces. The intrinsic horizon geometry is specified by a set of mass and angular-momentum multipole moments $\\mathcal{M}_n$ and $\\mathcal{J}_n$ respectively.   The tidal deformations are described by the change in these multipole moments caused by an external perturbation. This leads us to define two sets of dimensionless numbers, the tidal coefficients for $\\mathcal{M}_n$ and $\\mathcal{J}_n$, which specify the deformations of a black hole with a binary companion. We compute these tidal coefficients in a specific model problem, namely the Bowen-York initial data set for binary black holes. We restrict ourselves to axisymmetric situations and to small spins. Within this approximation, we analytically compute the conformal factor, the location of the marginally trapped surfaces, and finally the multipole moments and the tidal coefficients. ",

In this context, we investigate how fermionic fields minimally and non-minimally coupled with the gravitational field may be responsible for accelerated regimes during the evolution of the Universe. The forms of the potential and coupling of the model are determined through the technique of the Noether symmetry for two cases. The first case comprises a Universe filled only with the fermion field. Cosmological solutions are straightforwardly obtained for this case and an exponential inflation mediated by the fermion field is possible with a non-minimal coupling. The second case takes account of the contributions of radiation and baryonic matter in the presence of the fermion field. In this case the fermion field plays the role of dark energy and dark matter, and when a non-minimal coupling is allowed, it mediates a power-law inflation. ",

    "abstract": "  Gravitational waves emitted from a generic binary black-hole merger carry away linear momentum anisotropically, resulting in a gravitational recoil, or \"kick\", of the center of mass. For certain merger configurations the time evolution of the magnitude of the kick velocity has a local maximum followed by a sudden drop. Perturbative studies of this \"antikick\" in a limited range of black hole spins have found that the antikick decreases for retrograde orbits as a function of negative spin. We analyze this problem using a recently developed code to evolve gravitational perturbations from a point-particle in Kerr spacetime driven by an effective-one-body resummed radiation reaction force at linear order in the mass ratio $\\nu\\ll 1$. Extending previous studies to nearly-extremal negative spins, we find that the well-known decrease of the antikick is overturned and, instead of approaching zero, the antikick increases again to reach $\\Delta v/(c\\nu^{2})=3.37\\times10^{-3}$ for dimensionless spin $\\hat{a}=-0.9999$. The corresponding final kick velocity is $v_{end}/(c\\nu^{2})=0.076$. This result is connected to the nonadiabatic character of the emission of linear momentum during the plunge. We interpret it analytically by means of the quality factor of the flux to capture quantitatively the main properties of the kick velocity. The use of such quality factor of the flux does not require trajectories nor horizon curvature distributions and should therefore be useful both in perturbation theory and numerical relativity. ",

    "abstract": "  In the present work, we revisit the process of gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric homogeneous dust fluid which is known as the Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS) model [1]. We show that such a scenario would not end in a spacetime singularity when the spin degrees of freedom of fermionic particles within the collapsing cloud are taken into account. To this purpose, we take the matter content of the stellar object as a homogeneous Weyssenhoff fluid which is a generalization of perfect fluid in general relativity (GR) to include the spin of matter. Employing the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW metric for the interior spacetime setup, it is shown that the spin of matter, in the context of a negative pressure, acts against the pull of gravity and decelerates the dynamical evolution of the collapse in its later stages. Our results bode a picture of gravitational collapse in which the collapse process halts at a finite radius whose value depends on the initial configuration. We thus show that the spacetime singularity that occurs in the OS model is replaced by a non-singular bounce beyond which the collapsing cloud re-expands to infinity. Depending on the model parameters, one can find a minimum value for the boundary of the collapsing cloud or correspondingly a threshold value for the mass content below which the horizon formation can be avoided. Our results are supported by a thorough numerical analysis. ",

    "abstract": "  The varying speed of light (VSL) theory is controversial. It succeeds in explaining some cosmological problems, but on the other hand it is excluded by mainstream physics because it will shake the foundation of physics. In the present paper, we devote ourselves to test whether the speed of light is varying from the observational data of the type Ia Supernova, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation, Observational $H(z)$ data and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We select the common form $c(t)=c_0a^n(t)$ with the contribution of dark energy and matter, where $c_0$ is the current value of speed of light, $n$ is a constant, and consequently construct a varying speed of light dark energy model (VSLDE). The combined observational data show a much trivial constraint $n=-0.0033 \\pm 0.0045$ at 68.3\\% confidence level, which indicates that the speed of light may be a constant with high significance. By reconstructing the time-variable $c(t)$, we find that the speed of light almost has no variation for redshift $z < 10^{-1}$. For high-$z$ observations, they are more sensitive to the VSLDE model, but the variation of speed of light is only in order of $10^{-2}$. We also introduce the geometrical diagnostic $Om (z)$ to show the difference between the VSLDE and $\\Lambda$CDM model. The result shows that the current data are difficult to differentiate them. All the results show that the observational data favor the constant speed of light. ",

In this scenario the explicit form of the matter wave equations is investigated in a general curved space-time, and then the equations are particularized to the flat case. Unlike traditional approaches of NGT, in which the gravitational field is responsible for breaking the symmetry of the flat Minkowski metric, we find more natural to consider that, in general, the metric of the space-time could be nonsymmetric even in the flat case. The physical consequences of this assumption are explored in detail. Interestingly enough, it is found that the metric tensor splits into a bosonic and a fermionic; the antisymmetric part of the metric is very sensitive to the spin and turns out to be undetectable for spinless scalar particles. However, fermions couple to it in a non-trivial way (only when there are interactions).

The motivation for this is mostly due to the causality issues allegedly present in the first order in the gradients theories. However, the decay of fluctuations in the system is also at stake when first order theories that couple heat with acceleration are used. This paper shows that although the introduction of the Maxwell-Cattaneo equation in the description of a simple relativistic fluid formally eliminates the generic instabilities identified by Hiscock and Lindblom in 1985, the hypothesis on the order of magnitude of the corresponding relaxation term contradicts the basic ordering in Knudsen's parameter present in the kinetic approach to hydrodynamics. It is shown that the time derivative, stabilizing term is of second order in such parameter and thus does not belong to the Navier-Stokes regime where the so-called instability arises. ",

    "abstract": "  The McGehee regularization is a method to study the singularity at the origin of the dynamical system describing a point particle in a plane moving under the action of a power-law potential. It was used by Belbruno and Pretorius to perform a dynamical system regularization of the singularity at the center of the motion of massless test particles in the Schwarzschild spacetime. In this paper, we generalize the McGehee transformation so that we can regularize the singularity at the origin of the dynamical system describing the motion of causal geodesics (timelike or null) in any stationary and spherically symmetric spacetime of Kerr-Schild form. We first show that the geodesics for both massive and massless particles can be described globally in the Kerr-Schild spacetime as the motion of a Newtonian point particle in a suitable radial potential and study the conditions under which the central singularity can be regularized using an extension of the McGehee method. As an example, we apply these results to causal geodesics in the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om spacetimes. Interestingly, the geodesic trajectories in the whole maximal extension of both spacetimes can be described by a single two-dimensional phase space with non-trivial topology. This topology arises from the presence of excluded regions in the phase space determined by the condition that the tangent vector of the geodesic be causal and future directed. ",

Multiple algorithmic implementations in the analysis of data from the first generation of ground-based gravitational wave interferometers have used different strategies for the suppression of non-Gaussian noise transients, and targeted different regions of the binary black hole parameter space. In this paper we compare the sensitivity of three such algorithms: matched filtering with full coalescence templates, matched filtering with ringdown templates and a morphology-independent excess power search. The comparison is performed at a fixed false alarm rate and relies on Monte-carlo simulations of binary black hole coalescences for spinning, non-precessing systems with total mass 25-350 solar mass, which covers the parameter space of stellar mass and intermediate mass black hole binaries. We find that in the mass range of 25 -100 solar mass the sensitive distance of the search, marginalized over source parameters, is best with matched filtering to full waveform templates, to within 10 percent at a false alarm rate of 3 events per year. In the mass range of 100-350 solar mass, the same comparison favors the morphology-independent excess power search to within 20 percent. The dependence on mass and spin is also explored. ",

We particularly motivate on the isotropic coordinate system (ICS) of the dBH in order to highlight the ambiguity to be appeared in the derivation of the Hawking temperature (T_{H}) via the HJ method. Besides, it will be shown that the ICS allows us to write the metric of the dBH in form of the Fermat metric, which renders possible of identification of the refractive index (n) of the dBH. It is unraveled that the value of n and therefore the gravitational lensing effect is decisive on the the tunneling rate of the HR. We also uncloak how one can resolve the discrepancy about the T_{H} of the dBH in spite of that lensing effect. ",

Motivated by this argument we consider the spacetimes with the compactly determined Cauchy horizons (CDCHs), the defining property of which is the compactness of $\\overline{J^-(\\EuScript U)}\\cap J^+(\\EuScript S_0)$, where $\\EuScript U$ is an open subset of the Cauchy horizon and $\\EuScript S_0$ is a Cauchy surface of the initial globally hyperbolic region $\\ingh$. The following two facts are established: 1) $\\ingh$ has no globally hyperbolic maximal extension. This means that by shaping appropriately a precompact portion of a globally hyperbolic region one can \\emph{force} the Universe to produce either a closed causal curve, or a quasiregular singularity, whichever it abhors less; 2) Before a CDCH is formed a null geodesic appears which infinitely approaches the horizon returning again and again in the same --- arbitrarily small --- region. The energy of the photon moving on such a geodesic increases with each passage, or at least falls insufficiently fast. As a result, an observer located in the mentioned region would see a bunch of photons passing through his laboratory with the arbitrarily large total energy. We speculate that this phenomenon may have observable consequences. ",

This work extends the work of Barack and Ori [1] who demonstrated that the regularization parameters for a point particle in geodesic motion in a Schwarzschild spacetime can be described solely by the leading and subleading terms in the mode-sum (commonly known as the $A$ and $B$ terms) and that all terms of higher order in $\\ell$ vanish upon summation (later they showed the same behavior for geodesic motion in Kerr [2], [3]). We demonstrate that these properties are universal to point particles moving through any smooth spacetime along arbitrary (accelerated) trajectories. Our renormalization scheme is based on, but not identical to, the Quinn-Wald axioms. As we develop our approach, we review and extend work showing that that different definitions of the singular field used in the literature are equivalent to our approach. Because our approach does not assume geodesic motion of the perturbing particle, we are able use our mode-sum formalism to explicitly recover a well-known result: The self-force on static scalar charges near a Schwarzschild black hole vanishes.

In the event of a detection, model selection and parameter estimation will be performed in order to explore the properties of the source. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian statistical method for extracting model-dependent parameters from observed gravitational-wave signals in frequency-time maps. We demonstrate the method by recovering the parameters of model gravitational-wave signals added to simulated advanced LIGO noise. We also characterize the performance of the method and discuss prospects for future work. ",

Yet, the problem is that Mach's principle is a consequence of Berkeley's notions, which are as good as irrefutable for their ontological nature. Moreover, the observed coincidence of the \"preferred inertial frame\" and the frame attached to the \"fixed stars\" is essentially Machian, while this coincidence is anomalous to both GR and Newtonian physics. Another issue is that GR needs dark energy to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe, while acceleration of receding masses is inherent to the Machian principle. So GR and Mach's principle question each other, while neither one can be falsified easily. This suggest that both are valid in their particular domain. A relational theory may reconcile the two, since it can cover both. ",

This dissertation is concerned with the phenomenon known as superradiance, that is, when this coefficient is larger than unity.   We shall explore many examples of such systems, and, more importantly, we shall also see how, apart from the interest in its own right, superradiance is related to a number of important current research physical issues. We begin with a small survey of important results on chapter one. On chapter two, we establish a general criteria to decide whether or not superradiant scattering is observed based on the linear, second order, homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) or linear, first order homogeneous systems of ODEs which describes the process and we shall give an example of system in which superradiance is observed. On chapter three, we focus on spinning black hole superradiance, we shall describe how one can compute explicitly the reflection coefficient for different spin waves. Chapter four is dedicated to the relations with thermodynamics. We develop what is meant by black hole thermodynamics, particularly the so-called first and second law of black hole thermodynamics, and apply them in the context of superradiance, so we can generalise some of the results from chapter three to more general black holes. Finally, on chapter five, we explore many of the quantum aspects of superradiance, including the relation with the Klein paradox, and the quantum version of black hole superradiance, for the later we will explain briefly how one usually quantise fields in curved space-time. A further connection with thermodynamics is explored. Thorough all this text we analyse the connection between superradiance and spin and statistics. ",

The scope of the analysis includes domains of the wave functions of Dirac's equation, hermiticity of Hamiltonians, and the possibility of existence of stationary bound states of spin-half particles. The constraint on the domain of the wave functions of the Hamiltonian in a Schwarzschild field in spherical coordinates (r > r_{0}) resulting from the fulfillment of Hilbert's condition g_{00} > 0 also holds in other coordinates for all the metrics considered. The self-adjoint Hamiltonians for the Schwarzschild metrics in the spherical, isotropic and harmonic coordinates and also for the Eddington-Finkelstein and Painleve-Gullstrand metrics are Hermitian, and for them the existence of stationary bound states of spin-half particles is possible. The self-adjoint Hamiltonians for non-stationary Lemaitre-Finkelstein and Kruskal metrics have the explicit dependence on the temporal coordinates and stationary bound states of spin-half particles cannot be defined for these Hamiltonians.

The chiral cosmological model has successive applications in descriptions of the inflationary epoch of the Universe evolution; the present accelerated expansion of the Universe also can be described by the chiral fields multiplet as the dark energy in wide sense.   To be more illustrative we are often addressed to the two-component chiral cosmological model. Namely, the two-component chiral cosmological model describing the phantom field with interaction to a canonical scalar field is analyzed in details. New generalized model of quintom character is proposed and exact solutions are founded out.   In the review we represented the perturbation theory for chiral cosmological model with the aim to describe the structure formation using the progress achieved in the inflation theory. It was shown that cosmological perturbations from chiral fields can be decomposed for inflaton and the dark sector perturbations. The two-component model is investigated in details, the general solution for shortwave approximation is obtained and analyzed for power law Universe expansion.   New issue for understanding the features of Universe evolution is proposed by consideration of the dark sector fields on the inflaton background. The results are illustrated for the solutions in the long-wave approximation. ",

We revisit this problem by solving the equation of motion of a particle coupled to vacuum fluctuations including the radiation reaction force. We compute a Fourier integral for the variance of the random velocity in a rigorous manner. Similarly, we consider a particle coupled to vacuum fluctuations in de Sitter spacetime motivated by the argument that an observer in de Sitter spacetime sees the Bunch-Davies vacuum as a thermally excited state with the Gibbons-Hawking temperature.

First, we show that the MOG in the absence of scalar fields is converted into $\\Lambda(t),G(t)$ models. Time evolution of the cosmological parameters for a family of viable models have been investigated. Numerical results with the cosmological data have been adjusted. We've introduced a model for dark energy (DE) density and cosmological constant which involves first order derivatives of Hubble parameter. To extend this model, correction terms including the gravitational constant are added. In our scenario, the cosmological constant is a function of time. To complete the model,interaction terms between dark energy and dark matter (DM) manually entered in phenomenological form. Instead of using the dust model for DM, we have proposed DM equivalent to a barotropic fluid. Time evolution of DM is a function of other cosmological parameters. Using sophisticated algorithms, the behavior of various quantities including the densities, Hubble parameter, etc. have been investigated graphically. The statefinder parameters have been used for the classification of DE models. Consistency of the numerical results with experimental data of $SneIa+BAO+CMB$ are studied by numerical analysis with high accuracy. ",

We then introduce a simplicial decomposition of the three-dimensional manifold and study the discretised action in the spinorial representation of loop gravity. A one-dimensional refinement limit along the edges of the discretisation brings us back to a continuum formulation. The three-dimensional action turns into a line integral over the one-skeleton of the simplicial manifold. All fields are continuous but have support only along the one-dimensional edges. We define the path integral, and remove the redundant integrals over the local gauge orbits through the usual Faddeev--Popov procedure.

These properties are of its own mathematical relevance and provide a solution of the physical `twin paradox' problem. The latter means that we focus our studies on the search of the longest timelike geodesics between two given points. Due to problems with solving the geodesic deviation equation we restrict our investigations to radial and circular (if exist) geodesics. On these curves we find general Jacobi vector fields, determine by means of them sequences of conjugate points and with the aid of the comoving coordinate system and the spherical symmetry we determine the cut points. These notions identify segments of radial and circular gepdesics which are locally or globally of maximal length. In de Sitter spacetime all geodesics are globally maximal. In CAdS and Bertotti--Robinson spacetimes the radial geodesics which infinitely many times oscillate between antipodal points in the space contain infinite number of equally separated conjugate points and there are no other cut points. Yet in these two spacetimes each outgoing or ingoing radial geodesic which does not cross the centre is globally of maximal length. Circular geodesics exist only in CAdS spacetime and contain an infinite sequence of equally separated conjugate points. The geodesic curves which intersect the circular ones at these points may either belong to the two-surface $\\theta=\\pi/2$ or lie outside it. ",

A practical issue in the problem is that when the parameter space is large and the available data is noisy, the geometry of the likelihood surface in the parameter space will be complicated. This makes searching and optimization algorithms computationally expensive, sometimes even beyond reach. In this paper, we define a likelihood transform which can make the structure of the likelihood surface much simpler, hence reducing the intrinsic complexity and easing optimization significantly. We demonstrate the properties of likelihood transform by apply it to a simplified gravitational wave chirp signal search. For the signal with an signal-to-noise ratio 20, likelihood transform has made a deterministic template-based search possible for the first time, which turns out to be 1000 times more efficient than an exhaustive grid- based search. The method in principle can be applied to other problems in other fields as the spirit of parameterized optimization and parameter estimation problem is the same. ",

The external vacuum metric of a spherical system is characterised by its mass alone. How many parameters characterise the external metric of a general stationary cylindrical system?

GBH is also known as Rindler modified Schwarzschild BH. Our aim is not only to investigate the effect of the Rindler parameter a on the Hawking temperature ($T_{H}$), but to examine whether there is any discrepancy between the computed horizon temperature and the standard $T_{H}$ as well. For this purpose, in addition to its naive coordinate system, we study on the three regular coordinate systems which are Painleve-Gullstrand (PG), ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein (IEF) and Kruskal-Szekeres (KS) coordinates. In all coordinate systems, we calculate the tunneling probabilities of incoming and outgoing scalar particles from the event horizon by using the HJ equation. It has been shown in detail that the considered HJ method is concluded with the conventional $T_{H}$ in all these coordinate systems without giving rise to the famous factor-2 problem. Furthermore, in the PG coordinates Parikh-Wilczek's tunneling (PWT) method is employed in order to show how one can integrate the quantum gravity (QG) corrections to the semiclassical tunneling rate by including the effects of self-gravitation and back reaction. We then show how these corrections yield a modification in the $T_{H}$. ",

Here we consider the Hamiltonian for a time-dependent Harmonic oscillator, with time-dependent mass and frequency. We derive the occupation number of the induced quasi-particles using the invariant operator method; in deriving the occupation number we also point out and make the connection between the Functional Schr\\\"odinger formalism, quantum kinetic equation, and Bogolyubov transformation between two different Fock space basis at equal times and explain the role in which the invariant operator plays. Using the flat FRW chart of de Sitter spacetime, we show that the different methods lead to different results: Instantaneous diagonalization leads to a power law distribution, while the Bogolyubov transformation and Unruh-de Witt detector both lead to thermal distributions. It is shown that the source of the discrepancy between the instantaneous diagonalization and Bogolyubov methods is the fact that there is no notion of well-defined particles in the out vacuum due to a divergent term. In the Bogolyubov method, this divergent term cancels leading to the thermal distribution, while in the instantaneous diagonalization there is no such cancelation. However, to obtain the thermal distribution in the usual Bogolyubov method, one must use the large mass limit. On physical grounds, one should expect that only the modes which have been allowed to sample the horizon would be thermal, thus in the large mass limit these modes are well within the horizon and, even though they do grow, they remain well within the horizon due to the mass. Thus one should not expect a thermal distribution since the modes won't have a chance to thermalize. ",

We argue that time on the boundary undergoes the Wick rotation and becomes purely imaginary. The Mixmaster (Bianchi IX) model of the early history of the universe is neatly explained in this picture by postulating that the reverse Wick rotation follows a hyperbolic geodesic connecting imaginary time axis to the real one.

We provide a class exact solutions on the boundary of the space of physical configurations. This will show that all the other known exact solutions are unphysical near the surface of the event horizon or in the interior. This will have important consequences for the no-hair conjecture and the kinds of persistent fields that can emerge from a black hole as well as the evolution during collisions and near grazing events. The interior of these holes are characterized by a limiting degenerate metric and these regions tend to well defined volumes and radii in contrast with what is inferred from singular solutions. Surprisingly, these depend on past history and not simply the mass or external fields of the body. It is shown that there is often a well defined \"hidden\" flat background that can be used to equivalently reformulate GR in terms of a classical nonlinear gravity field and gives local conservation laws. This has implications for unification efforts and numerical approaches to handle the degenerate metric regions reminiscent of the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions.

We study the density fluctuations in the new picture and obtain an approximate analytic expression of the power spectrum. The energy scale at the horizon crossing is depressed by both noncanonical effect and thermal effect, and so is the tensor-to-scalar ratio.

In order to evade any unnecessary controversy regarding frames (i.e. Einstein .vs. Jordan) the theory is treated using the original variables instead of transforming them to a scalar-tensor theory. The field equations are derived directly from the original Lagrangian using the variational principle. The cosmological equations are different from the Friedmann equations, but the acceleration equation gives the same result as the one of the $\\Lambda $CDM model in the matter-dominated era. Furthermore, it indicates an inflation in the early time and the radiation-dominated era as the Starobinsky model. The cosmological constant naturally emerges from the Yang-Mills terms of the Lagrangian rather than be added artificially. The equation of state of the dark energy depends on the density of the matter and then the coincidence and fine tuning problem is solved naturally.   In order to compare with the popular $\\Lambda $CDM model, the cosmological perturbations is investigated. The equations for linear perturbations of the metric and for the density contrast growth are derived. The explicit analytic solutions are obtained. The gravitational potential and the growth of the baryon matter density perturbation can be used to clarify whether this model is in agreement with standard $\\Lambda $CDM predictions and experimental data.

Armed with these equations, we are able to develop the Hadamard series which can be associated with the fundamental solution of the equations, wherein we introduce an inhomogeneous singularity at the physical space-time point of the perturbing particle.

    "abstract": "  Since it is commonly believed that the observed large-scale structure of the Universe is an imprint of quantum fluctuations existing at the very early stage of its evolution, it is reasonable to pose the question: Do the effects of quantum nonlocality, which are well established now by the laboratory studies, manifest themselves also in the early Universe? We try to answer this question by utilizing the results of a few experiments, namely, with the superconducting multi-Josephson-junction loops and the ultracold gases in periodic potentials. Employing a close analogy between the above-mentioned setups and the simplest one-dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological model, we show that the specific nonlocal correlations revealed in the laboratory studies might be of considerable importance also in treating the strongly-nonequilibrium phase transitions of Higgs fields in the early Universe. Particularly, they should substantially reduce the number of topological defects (e.g., domain walls) expected due to independent establishment of the new phases in the remote spatial regions. This gives us a hint for resolving a long-standing problem of the excessive concentration of topological defects, inconsistent with observational constraints. The same effect may be also relevant to the recent problem of the anomalous behavior of cosmic microwave background fluctuations at large angular scales. ",

The guiding principle is the choice of an exotic smoothness structure for the space-time. Here we consider a space-time with topology $S^{3}\\times\\mathbb{R}$. In case of an exotic $S^{3}\\times\\mathbb{R}$, there is a change in the spatial topology from a 3-sphere to a homology 3-sphere which can carry a hyperbolic structure. From the physical point of view, we will discuss the path integral for the Einstein-Hilbert action with respect to a decomposition of the space-time. The inclusion of the boundary terms produces fermionic contributions to the partition function. The expectation value of an area (with respect to some surface) shows an exponential increase, i.e. we obtain inflationary behavior. We will calculate the amount of this increase to be a topological invariant. Then we will describe this transition by an effective model, the Starobinski or $R^{2}$ model which is consistent with the current measurement of the Planck satellite. The spectral index and other observables are also calculated. Finally we obtain a realistic cosmological constant. ",

The very high energies observed in SGRBs have been suggested to stem from neutrino-antineutrino annihilation and/or from very strong magnetic fields created during or after the merger by mechanisms like the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Here, we report on results that show for the first time the development of the MRI in HMNSs in three-dimensional, fully general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations.

    "abstract": "  Recent results show that important singularities in General Relativity can be naturally described in terms of finite and invariant canonical geometric objects. Consequently, one can write field equations which are equivalent to Einstein's at non-singular points, but in addition remain well-defined and smooth at singularities. The black hole singularities appear to be less undesirable than it was thought, especially after we remove the part of the singularity due to the coordinate system. Black hole singularities are then compatible with global hyperbolicity, and don't make the evolution equations break down, when these are expressed in terms of the appropriate variables. The charged black holes turn out to have smooth potential and electromagnetic fields in the new atlas. Classical charged particles can be modeled, in General Relativity, as charged black hole solutions. Since black hole singularities are accompanied by dimensional reduction, this should affect Feynman's path integrals. Therefore, it is expected that singularities induce dimensional reduction effects in Quantum Gravity. These dimensional reduction effects are very similar to those postulated in some approaches to making Quantum Gravity perturbatively renormalizable. This may provide a way to test indirectly the effects of singularities, otherwise inaccessible. ",

Since the linear line element is an operator, we treat it according to the rules of quantum mechanics and interpret its eigenvalues as physically observable distances; the distance eigenvalues are naturally quantized. There are both positive and negative eigenvalues, which requires interpretation. Multi-element curves are defined as direct sums of line elements, and behave much like systems of spin half electrons in a magnetic field. For a curve of many elements an entropy and energy and temperature are quite naturally defined, leading via standard statistical thermodynamics to a relation between the most probable curve length and temperature. That relation may be viewed as a universal heat-shrinking property of curves. At this stage of the theory we do not include bodies or particles in the mix, do not suggest field equations for the quantum geometry, and questions of interpretation remain. The theory might conceivably be testable using observations of the early Universe, when the temperature of space was presumably quite high. In particular cosmogenesis may be thought of as time stopping at an infinite temperature as we go backwards in time to the beginning. ",

In other words, MOND-like phenomenology can be reproduced when appropriate generalised concepts at the thermodynamical level of space and/or at the holographic principle are introduced. Thermodynamical modifications are reflected in extensions to the equipartition law which occur when the temperature of the system drops below a critical value, equals to Unruh's temperature evaluated at the acceleration constant scale introduced for the description of the gravitational phenomena.

We present a general relativistic model for the phase of a plane wave that accounts for contributions of all the multipoles of the gravitating body, its angular momentum, as well as the contribution of tidal fields produced by external sources. We develop a new approach to model a coherent signal transmission in the gravitational field of the solar system that relies on a relativistic treatment of the phase.

We develop a relativistic model for the LRI-enabled range between the two GRACE-FO spacecraft, accurate to less than 1 nm, and a high-precision model for the corresponding range rate, accurate to better than 0.1 nm/s. We also formulate high-precision relativistic models for the double one-way range (DOWR) and DOWR-enabled range rate observables originally used on GRACE and now studied for interferometric measurements on GRACE-FO.

When the equations are projected to space-time (giving the \"general relativistic limit\"), the extra terms that appear due to our generalization can be interpreted as \"matter terms\", as in Kaluza-Klein-type models. To illustrate this effect we further simplify the metric matrix to a block diagonal form, compute for it the generalized Einstein equations and find two of their \"Friedmann-like\" solutions for the special case when $G =\\mathbb{Z}_2$.

The analysis of the equations of motion resulting from a steepest descent procedure showed the existence of solutions displaying a minimum value of the volume scaling function which are, in turn, compatible with a physically inspired definition for a bounce. More importantly, a lower bound for the volume at the bounce which incorporates quantum mechanical and noncommutativite contributions was established. The asymptotic analysis of the solutions in the vicinity of the bounce was performed by implementing techniques used in boundary-layer problems.

By use of different constitutive relations (local and non-local, linear and non-linear, etc.), a wide area of applications can be covered. In the current paper, we present the jump conditions for the fields and for the energy-momentum tensor on an arbitrarily moving surface between two media. From the differential and integral Maxwell equations, we derive the covariant boundary conditions, which are independent of any metric and connection. These conditions include the covariantly defined surface current and are applicable to an arbitrarily moving smooth curved boundary surface. As an application of the presented jump formulas, we derive a Lorentzian type metric as a condition for existence the wave front in isotropic media.

This question is important because our universe seems to have done just that! We construct an explicit, simple, example of such a system with just two degrees of freedom, of which one achieves `spontaneous classicalization'. It starts from a quantum state and under the usual Hamiltonian evolution, becomes more and more classical (in a well-defined manner in terms of the Wigner function) as time progresses. This is achieved without the usual procedures of integrating out a large number of environmental degrees of freedom or conventional decoherence. We consider different ranges of parameter space and identify the conditions under which spontaneous classicalization occurs in our model. The mutual interaction between the sub-systems of a larger system can indeed drive some of the subsystems to a classical configuration, with a phase space trajectory of evolution. We also argue that the results of our toy model may well be general characteristics of certain class of interacting systems. Several implications are discussed. ",

Indeed, if the black-hole which forms after the merger, is surrounded by a massive disk, neutrino annihilation processes may produce high-energy and collimated electromagnetic radiation. In this paper, we devise a new procedure, to be used in the search for gravitational waves from black-hole-neutron-star binaries, to assign a probability that a detected gravitational signal is associated to the formation of an accreting disk, massive enough to power gamma-ray bursts. This method is based on two recently proposed semi-analytic fits, one reproducing the mass of the remnant disk surrounding the black hole as a function of some binary parameters, the second relating the neutron star compactness, with its tidal deformability. Our approach can be used in low-latency data analysis to restrict the parameter space searching for gravitational signals associated with short gamma-ray bursts, and to gain information on the dynamics of the coalescing system and on the neutron star equation of state.

Numerical calculations show that the eastbound Sagnac interferometer might be preferred for testing CS separately, because LT effects on this interferometer cancel out. The size of the phase shift induced in the CS model might have an oscillatory dependence also on the altitude of the interferometer through the CS mass parameter $m_{CS}$.

In particular, assuming that two epochs are each other entangled, by measuring the entanglement degree, it is possible to recover dynamical properties of the universe. In particular, the effects of dark energy could be due to the entanglement between states, since a negative pressure arises at late times. In this process, we choose as ruler to quantify the entanglement weight, the so called negativity of entanglement. It follows that a natural anti-gravitational effect occurs when the cosmological eras are entangled. Thus, dark energy could be seen as a straightforward consequence of entanglement. Specifically, our results can be compared with observational data. In doing so, it is possible to show that a pressureless term is recovered at a certain epoch dominating over dark energy and ruling the structure formation. ",

The characteristic frequencies of the non-Keplerian orbital variations of $m$ and of $M$ itself are assumed to be negligible with respect to both $n_{\\rm b}$ and $n_{\\rm b}^{'}$.

Although future improvements in spacecraft tracking and orbit determination might, perhaps, reach the required sensitivity, the systematic bias represented by the other known orbital perturbations of both Newtonian and post-Newtonian origin would be overwhelming.

Since the function $f(\\mathcal{R})$ is not known \\emph{a priori}, the need of a model independent reconstruction of its shape represents a relevant technique to determine which $f(\\mathcal{R})$ model is really favored with respect to others. To this aim, we relate cosmography to a generic $f(\\mathcal R)$ and its derivatives in order to provide a model independent investigation at redshift $z \\sim 0$. Our analysis is based on the use of three different cosmological distance definitions, in order to alleviate the duality problem, i.e. the problem of which cosmological distance to use with specific cosmic data sets. We therefore consider the luminosity, $d_L$, flux, $d_F$, and angular, $d_A$, distances and we find numerical constraints by the Union 2.1 supernovae compilation and measurement of baryonic acoustic oscillations, at $z_{BAO}=0.35$. We notice that all distances reduce to the same expression, i.e. $d_{L;F;A}\\sim\\frac{1}{\\mathcal H_0}z$, at first order. Thus, to fix the cosmographic series of observables, we impose the initial value of $H_0$ by fitting $\\mathcal H_0$ through supernovae only, in the redshift regime $z<0.4$. We find that the pressure of curvature dark energy fluid is slightly lower than the one related to the cosmological constant. This indicates that a possible evolving curvature dark energy realistically fills the current universe. Moreover, the combined use of $d_L,d_F$ and $d_A$ shows that the sign of the acceleration parameter agrees with theoretical bounds, while its variation, namely the jerk parameter, is compatible with $j_0>1$. Finally, we infer the functional form of $f(\\mathcal{R})$ by means of a truncated polynomial approximation, in terms of fourth order scale factor $a(t)$. ",

The effective cosmological constant is given as a sum of 3 terms: the classical CC, the quantum gravity CC and the matter CC. Since the observations can only measure the sum of these 3 terms, we can choose the classical CC to be equal to the negative value of the matter CC. Hence the effective CC is given only by the quantum gravity CC, which is determined by the path-integral measure. Since the path-integral measure depends on a free parameter, this parameter can be chosen such that the effective CC gives the observed value. ",

    "abstract": "  In this Thesis we will explicitly construct Hadamard states with different features. In the two first cases, the states will be constructed in static and in cosmological spacetimes. In one of the cases, the states will be constructed in such a way as to minimize the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a free massive scalar field, multiplied by a suitable smooth function of compact support, in a cosmological spacetime. The final form of the state clearly reduces to the vacuum in a static spacetime. Besides, we will show that these are Hadamard states. They do not contradict the above mentioned nonexistence of a unique prescription because they depend on the chosen smooth function. In the other case, we will calculate the positive part of the spectral decomposition of the commutator function in a specific subset of the spacetime and will show that, in static and in cosmological spacetimes, the kernel of this function, once again multiplied by a suitable smooth function of compact support, corresponds to the kernel of Hadamard states. In both cases, the construction of the states does not rely on invariance under the action of a group of symmetries. Such a group may not even exist, in these cases.   In the last case we will construct a state in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, which describes a universe with a black hole and a cosmological constant. This state is invariant under the action of the group of symmetries of this spacetime, although it is not defined in its whole Kruskal extension. In this way, we avoid the situation in which the authors of (KayWald91) showed that a Hadamard state cannot exist. We will show that the state we construct is Hadamard and that it is not thermal, differently from the case of states constructed in spacetimes containing only one event horizon (DappiaggiMorettiPinamonti09,GibbonsHawking77).

In this paper, we analytically calculate the gravitomagnetic corrections to both the draconitic and to the anomalistic periods of arbitrarily inclined, quasi-circular orbits for a generic orientation of the spin axis of the primary. While the anomalistic period is left unchanged, the draconitic one experiences a generally non-vanishing correction which, to zero order in the eccentricity, gains a minus sign if the velocity of the test particle is reversed. As a result, a gravitomagnetic draconitic clock effect arises since a generally non-zero difference of the draconitic periods of a pair of counter-orbiting test particles arises. Remarkably, it is independent of their initial conditions, with some advantages from an experimental point of view because, in principle, the data could be collected independently of each other and at different epochs. Numerically integrations of the equations of motion confirm our analytical results. The relativistic time difference turns out to be up to about $0.5$ ms and $0.1$ ms around Jupiter and the Sun, respectively, while it is as little as $0.6$ $\\mu$s around the Earth. ",

In this paper, we show that, to the first post-Newtonian level, there is also a gravitolectric clock effect induced by the static component of the gravitational field of a non-rotating body. Indeed, the difference of the draconitic periods of two test particles moving in opposite directions along identical quasi-circular orbits turns out to be non-vanishing. It depends on the shape, the size and the pericenter location of the orbit, but it is independent of the initial position along it. On the contrary, the gravitoelectric corrections to the anomalistic periods turn out to be the same for both prograde and retrograde orbital motions. For a hypothetical pair of Earth satellites in Supertundra-like orbits, the gravitoelectric draconitic clock effect could be as large as 46 $\\mu$s, while a Juno-like orbital configuration around Jupiter would allow to reach about $0.01$ s.

We find that the atomic transition rates depend on both the nature of de Sitter spacetime and the motion of atoms, interestingly the steady states for both cases are always driven to being purely thermal, regardless of the atomic initial states. This thermalization phenomenon is structurally similar to what happens to an elementary quantum system immersed in a thermal field, and thus reveals the thermal nature of de Sitter spacetime. Besides, we find that the thermal baths will drive the entanglement shared by the freely falling atom (the static atom) and its auxiliary partner, a same two-level atom which is isolated from external fields, to being sudden death, and the proper time for the entanglement to be extinguished is computed. We also analyze that such thermalization and disentanglement phenomena, in principle, could be understood from the perspective of table-top simulation experiment. ",

Even by conservatively rescaling by a factor of ten the EPM2013 formal uncertainties in the orbital elements of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto over a century (1913-2013), it turns out that their numerically simulated centennial signatures due to a distant perturber 15 times more massive than the Earth located at about 200 astronomical units in an almost circular and ecliptical orbit are far larger, thus making its existence highly unlikely. A careful analysis of the full parameter space of the hypothesized rock-ice planetoid further confirms such a conclusion.

    "abstract": "  Radial fall has historically played a momentous role. It is one of the most classical problems, the solutions of which represent the level of understanding of gravitation in a given epoch. A {\\it gedankenexperiment} in a modern frame is given by a small body, like a compact star or a solar mass black hole, captured by a supermassive black hole. The mass of the small body itself and the emission of gravitational radiation cause the departure from the geodesic path due to the back-action, that is the self-force. For radial fall, as any other non-adiabatic motion, the instantaneous identity of the radiated energy and the loss of orbital energy cannot be imposed and provide the perturbed trajectory. In the first part of this letter, we present the effects due to the self-force computed on the geodesic trajectory in the background field. Compared to the latter trajectory, in the Regge-Wheeler, harmonic and all others smoothly related gauges, a far observer concludes that the self-force pushes inward (not outward) the falling body, with a strength proportional to the mass of the small body for a given large mass; further, the same observer notes an higher value of the maximal coordinate velocity, this value being reached earlier on during infall. In the second part of this letter, we implement a self-consistent approach for which the trajectory is iteratively corrected by the self-force, this time computed on osculating geodesics. Finally, we compare the motion driven by the self-force without and with self-consistent orbital evolution. Subtle differences are noticeable, even if self-force effects have hardly the time to accumulate in such a short orbit. ",

Despite many valiant attempts at pedagogically clear presentations, the effect nevertheless still continues to generate some significant confusion. Part of the confusion arises from the fact that super-radiance in a quantum field theory [QFT] context is not the same as super-radiance (super-fluorescence) in some condensed matter contexts; part of the confusion arises from traditional but sometimes awkward normalization conventions, and part is due to sometimes unnecessary confusion between fluxes and probabilities. We shall argue that the key point underlying the effect is flux conservation, (and, in the presence of dissipation, a controlled amount of flux non-conservation), and that attempting to phrase things in terms of reflection and transmission probabilities only works in the absence of super-radiance. To help clarify the situation we present a simple exactly solvable toy model exhibiting both super-radiance and damping. ",

The first approach is the standard one and is based on evolution on Cauchy hypersurfaces with artificial timelike boundary. The well posedness of a set of constraint-preserving boundary conditions for the Einstein equations in generalised harmonic gauge is analysed, their numerical performance is compared with various alternate methods, and improved absorbing boundary conditions are constructed and implemented. In the second approach, one solves the Einstein equations on hyperboloidal (asymptotically characteristic) hypersurfaces. These are conformally compactified towards future null infinity, where gravitational radiation is defined in an unambiguous way. We show how the formally singular terms arising in a $3+1$ reduction of the equations can be evaluated at future null infinity, present stable numerical evolutions of vacuum axisymmetric black hole spacetimes and study late-time power-law tails of matter fields in spherical symmetry.

By using a geometrical covariant procedure, which allows the construction of holographic hypersurfaces, we have obtained for each case the position of the preferred screen and have then compared these with those obtained by using the holographic dark energy model with the future event horizon as the infrared cutoff. In the phantom scenario, one of the two obtained holographic screens is placed on the big rip hypersurface, both for the covariant holographic formalism and the holographic phantom model. It is also analyzed whether the existence of these preferred screens allows a mathematically consistent formulation of fundamental theories based on the existence of a S matrix at infinite distances.

We consider a binary system composed of an IMBH surrounded by a DM mini-spike and a stellar mass object orbiting around the IMBH. The binary evolves due to gravitational pull and dynamical friction from the DM mini-spike and back-reaction from its gravitational wave (GW) radiation which can be detected by future space-borne GW experiments such as eLISA/NGO. We consider a single power-law model for the DM mini-spike which is assumed to consist of non-annihilating DM particles and demonstrate that an eLISA/NGO detection of GW from such a binary enables us to measure the DM mini-spike parameters very accurately. For instance, in our reference case originally advocated by Zhao and Silk (2005) and Bertone et al. (2005), we could determine the power-law index $\\alpha$ of the DM mini-spike radial profile with a 1 $\\sigma$ relative error of $\\pm 5\\times 10^{-6}$ for a GW signal with signal-to-noise-ratio 10 and assuming a 5 year observation with eLISA. We also investigate how accurately the DM parameters can be determined for various DM parameters and the masses of the IMBH-stellar mass object binary surrounded by a DM mini-spike. We find that we can determine the power-law index $\\alpha$ at 10 % level even for a slightly flatter radial distribution of $\\alpha \\sim 1.7$. ",

However, it is possible to give otherwise equivalent formulations of the Einstein, Maxwell and Yang-Mills equations, which in addition admit solutions which can be extended beyond the singularities.

In both case of massive and massless vector fields, the short distance limit of the full propagator agrees with the flat space-time propagator. In the case of massive propagator, the transverse part has a well defined massless limit, and in this limit it goes to the transverse propagator for the massless fields. The transverse propagator for antipodal point separation is nonzero and negative, but vanishes in the flat space-time limit (Ricci scalar going to zero). The longitudinal part of the massive propagator diverges as $1/m^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the field. The longitudinal part of the massless propagator is gauge dependent and in particular is proportional to the gauge parameter used in the gauge fixing condition. It vanishes in the Landau gauge.

A complete set of mode functions is constructed and the positive-frequency Wightman function is evaluated for both the cylindrical and hemispherical subspaces. On the base of this, the vacuum expectation values of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor are investigated. The mean field squared and the normal stress are finite on the boundary separating two subspaces, whereas the energy density and the parallel stress diverge as the inverse power of the distance from the boundary. For a conformally coupled field, the vacuum energy density is negative on the cylindrical part of the space. On the hemisphere, it is negative near the top and positive close to the boundary. In the case of minimal coupling the energy density on the cup is negative. On the tube it is positive near the boundary and negative at large distances. Though the geometries of the subspaces are different, the Casimir pressures on the separate sides of the boundary are equal and the net Casimir force vanishes. The results obtained may be applied to capped carbon nanotubes described by an effective field theory in the long-wavelength approximation. ",

Among those, the project GBAR in CERN aims to measure precisely the gravitational fall of ultracold antihydrogen atoms. In the ultracold regime, the interaction of antihydrogen atoms with a surface is governed by the phenomenon of quantum reflection which results in bouncing of antihydrogen atoms on matter surfaces. This allows the application of a filtering scheme to increase the precision of the free fall measurement. In the ultimate limit of smallest vertical velocities, antihydrogen atoms are settled in gravitational quantum states in close analogy to ultracold neutrons (UCNs). Positronium is another neutral system involving antimatter for which free fall under gravity is currently being investigated at UCL. Building on the experimental techniques under development for the free fall measurement, gravitational quantum states could also be observed in positronium. In this contribution, we review the status of the ongoing experiments and discuss the prospects of observing gravitational quantum states of antimatter and their implications. ",

    "abstract": "  As first emphasized by Bernard Schutz, there exists a universal distribution of signal-to-noise ratios for gravitational wave detection. Because gravitational waves (GWs) are almost impossible to obscure via dust absorption or other astrophysical processes, the strength of the detected signal is dictated solely by the emission strength and the distance to the source. Assuming that the space density of an arbitrary population of GW sources does not evolve, we show explicitly that the distribution of detected signal-to-noise (SNR) values depends solely on the detection threshold; it is independent of the detector network (interferometer or pulsar timing array), the individual detector noise curves (initial or Advanced LIGO), the nature of the GW sources (compact binary coalescence, supernova, or some other discrete source), and the distributions of source variables (only non-spinning neutron stars of mass exactly $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ or a complicated distribution of masses and spins). We derive the SNR distribution for each individual detector within a network as a function of the relative detector orientations and sensitivities. While most detections will have SNR near the detection threshold, there will be a tail of events to higher SNR. We derive the SNR distribution of the loudest (highest SNR) events in any given sample of detections. We find that the median SNR of the loudest out of the first four events should have an $\\mbox{SNR}=22$ (for a threshold of 12, appropriate for the Advanced LIGO/Virgo network), increasing to a median value for the loudest SNR of 47 for 40 detections. We expect these loudest events to provide particularly powerful constraints on their source parameters, and they will play an important role in extracting astrophysics from gravitational wave sources. These distributions also offer an important internal calibration of the response of the GW detector networks. ",

The main feature of these models is that comoving observers do not follow geodesics. In particular, comoving perfect fluids have necessarily a radially dependent pressure. We consider a subclass of these models characterized by some inhomogeneity parameter $\\beta$. We show that also the velocity of sound, like the (effective) equation of state parameter, of comoving perfect fluids acquire away from the origin a time and radial dependent change proportional to $\\beta$. In order to produce a realistic universe accelerating at late times without dark energy component one must take $\\beta < 0$. The redshift gets a modified dependence on the scale factor $a(t)$ with a relative modification of $-9\\%$ peaking at $z\\sim 4$ and vanishing at the big-bang and today on our past lightcone. The equation of state parameter and the speed of sound of dustlike matter (corresponding to a vanishing pressure at the center of symmetry $r=0$) behave in a similar way and away from the center of symmetry they become negative -- a property usually encountered for the dark energy component only. In order to mimic the observed late-time accelerated expansion, the matter component must significantly depart from standard dust, presumably ruling this subclass of Stephani models out as a realistic cosmology. The only way to accept these models is to keep all standard matter components of the universe including dark energy and take an inhomogeneity parameter $\\beta$ small enough. ",

This property turns out to be equivalent to a time-dependent, sign changing curvature. The cosmological equations obtained agree with those of the nonrelativistic model but they are given a new physical interpretation.

The article also serves as a brief preview of the 12 invited chapters that contain in-depth reviews of these advances. The volume will be published by Cambridge University Press and released in June 2015 at a Centennial conference sponsored by ISGRG and the Topical Group of Gravitation of the American Physical Society.

First, we extend the region of existence in Christodoulou's theorem on the formation of trapped surfaces and consequently show that the lower bound required to form a trapped surface can be relaxed. Second, we demonstrate that trapped surfaces form dynamically from a class of initial data which are large merely in a scaling-critical norm. This result is motivated in part by the scaling in Christodoulou's formation of trapped surfaces theorem for the Einstein-scalar field system in spherical symmetry. ",

    "abstract": "  It has recently been noticed that the degeneracies of the Poisson bracket of linearized gravity on constant curvature Lorentzian manifold can be described in terms of the cohomologies of a certain complex of differential operators. This complex was first introduced by Calabi and its cohomology is known to be isomorphic to that of the (locally constant) sheaf of Killing vectors. We review the structure of the Calabi complex in a novel way, with explicit calculations based on representation theory of GL(n), and also some tools for studying its cohomology in terms of of locally constant sheaves. We also conjecture how these tools would adapt to linearized gravity on other backgrounds and to other gauge theories. The presentation includes explicit formulas for the differential operators in the Calabi complex, arguments for its local exactness, discussion of generalized Poincar\\'e duality, methods of computing the cohomology of locally constant sheaves, and example calculations of Killing sheaf cohomologies of some black hole and cosmological Lorentzian manifolds.

We have parallelized the code using the Message Passing Interface standard, implemented a mechanism for combining the searches at different sky-positions and frequency bands into one extremely scalable program. The parallel I/O interface is used to escape bottlenecks, when writing the generated data into file system. This allowed to develop a highly scalable computation code, which would enable the data analysis at large scales on acceptable time scales. Benchmarking of the code on a Cray XE6 system was performed to show efficiency of our parallelization concept and to demonstrate scaling up to 50 thousand cores in parallel. ",

A semi-analytic Monte Carlo simulation is carried out to understand the cosmic black hole merger histories starting from intermediate mass black holes at high redshift as well as the possible scientific merits of the mission options considered in probing the light seed black holes and their coevolution with galaxies in early Universe. The study indicates that, by choosing the armlength of the interferometer to be three million kilometers and shifting the sensitivity floor to around one-hundredth Hz, together with a very moderate improvement on the position noise budget, there are certain mission options capable of exploring light seed, intermediate mass black hole binaries at high redshift that are not readily accessible to eLISA/LISA, and yet the technological requirements seem to within reach in the next few decades for China.

Although development of black-hole gravitational-wave templates in the past decade has been revolutionary, the corresponding work for double neutron-star systems has lagged. Neutron stars can be well-modelled as simple barotropic fluids during the part of binary inspiral most relevant to gravitational wave astronomy, but the crucial geometric and mathematical consequences of this simplification have remained computationally unexploited. In particular, Carter and Lichnerowicz have described barotropic fluid motion via classical variational principles as conformally geodesic. Moreover, Kelvin's circulation theorem implies that initially irrotational flows remain irrotational. Applied to numerical relativity, these concepts lead to novel Hamiltonian or Hamilton-Jacobi schemes for evolving relativistic fluid flows. Hamiltonian methods can conserve not only flux, but also circulation and symplecticity, and moreover do not require addition of an artificial atmosphere typically required by standard conservative methods. These properties can allow production of high-precision gravitational waveforms at low computational cost. This canonical hydrodynamics approach is applicable to a wide class of problems involving theoretical or computational fluid dynamics. ",

    "abstract": "  Most searches for continuous gravitational-waves from pulsars use Taylor expansions in the phase to model the spin-down of neutron stars. Studies of pulsars demonstrate that their electromagnetic (EM) emissions suffer from \\emph{timing noise}, small deviations in the phase from Taylor expansion models. How the mechanism producing EM emission is related to any continuous gravitational-wave (CW) emission is unknown; if they either interact or are locked in phase then the CW will also experience timing noise. Any disparity between the signal and the search template used in matched filtering methods will result in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), referred to as `mismatch'. In this work we assume the CW suffers a similar level of timing noise to its EM counterpart. We inject and recover fake CW signals, which include timing noise generated from observational data on the Crab pulsar. Measuring the mismatch over durations of order $\\sim 10$ months, the effect is for the most part found to be small. This suggests recent so-called `narrow-band' searches which placed upper limits on the signals from the Crab and Vela pulsars will not be significantly affected. At a fixed observation time, we find the mismatch depends upon the observation epoch. Considering the averaged mismatch as a function of observation time, we find that it increases as a power law with time, and so may become relevant in long baseline searches. ",

    "abstract": "  We investigate the potential impact of mass inflation inside black holes on the dynamics of the Universe, considering a recent reformulation of general relativity, proposed in [1], which prevents the vacuum energy from acting as a gravitational source. The interior dynamics of accreting black holes is studied, at the classical level, using the homogeneous approximation and taking charge as a surrogate for angular momentum. We show that, depending on the accreting fluid properties, mass inflation inside black holes could influence the value of the cosmological constant and thus the dynamics of the Universe. A full assessment of the cosmological role played by black holes will require a deeper understanding of the extremely energetic regimes expected inside real astrophysical black holes, including their relation with the physics of the very early Universe, and may eventually lead to an entirely new paradigm for the origin and evolution of the Universe.

    "abstract": "  We study the asymptotic dynamics of the Mixmaster Universe, near the cosmological singularity, considering $f(R)$ gravity up to a quadratic corrections in the Ricci scalar $R$. The analysis is performed in the scalar-tensor framework and adopting Misner-Chitr\\'e-like variables to describe the Mixmaster Universe, whose dynamics resembles asymptotically a billiard-ball in a given domain of the half-Poincar\\'e space. The form of the potential well depends on the spatial curvature of the model and on the particular form of the self-interacting scalar field potential. We demonstrate that the potential walls determine an open domain in the configuration region, allowing the point-Universe to reach the absolute of the considered Lobachevsky space. In other words, we outline the existence of a stable final Kasner regime in the Mixmaster evolution, implying the chaos removal near the cosmological singularity. The relevance of the present issue relies both on the general nature of the considered dynamics, allowing its direct extension to the BKL conjecture too, as well as the possibility to regard the considered modified theory of gravity as the first correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action as a Taylor expansion of a generic function $f(R)$ (as soon as a cut-off on the space-time curvature takes place).

Similarly to the well known pp-waves, these travelling wave solutions may depend on arbitrary functions of a null coordinate which determine the arbitrary profiles and polarizations of the waves. However, in contrast with pp-waves, these waves do not admit the null Killing vector fields and can exist in some curved (expanding and spatially homogeneous) background space-times, where these waves propagate in certain directions without any scattering. Mathematically, some of these classes of solutions arise as the fixed points of Kramer-Neugebauer transformations for hyperbolic integrable reductions of the mentioned above field equations, or, in the other cases, -- after imposing of the ansatz that these waves do not change the part of spatial metric transversal to the direction of wave propagation.

This is entirely different from the case of $w > 1$ studied in \\cite{Xue:2014}, where $w$ approaches a constant value $w_c > 1$ as the universe contracts. In that case a continuous transition through the big bang to yield a unique extension was possible only for a discrete set of $w_c$ satisfying coprime conditions. We also show that there exists another time variable, $N$, at the big bang singularity itself, at $t=0$, where $w$, varies as a function of $N$. This defines an {\\em extended big bang state}. Within it, $H$ is infinity. In the extended state, $w$ varies from a universe dominated by the cosmological constant to $1$. After $w$ reaches $1$ then the big bang occurs and time $t >0$ resumes.

    "abstract": "  Hawking radiation is generally derived using a non-interacting field theory. Some time ago, Leahy and Unruh showed that, in two dimensions with a Schwarzschild geometry, a scalar field theory with a quartic interaction gets the coupling switched off near the horizon of the black hole. This would imply that interaction has no effect on Hawking radiation and free theory for particles can be used. Recently, a set of exact classical solutions for the quartic scalar field theory has been obtained. These solutions display a massive dispersion relation even if the starting theory is massless. When one considers the corresponding quantum field theory, this mass gap becomes a tower of massive excitations and, at the leading order, the theory is trivial. We apply these results to Hawking radiation for a Kerr geometry and prove that the Leahy-Unruh effect is at work. Approaching the horizon the scalar field theory has the mass gap going to zero. We devise a technique to study the interacting scalar theory very near the horizon increasing the coupling. As these solutions are represented by a Fourier series of plane waves, Hawking radiation can be immediately obtained with well-known techniques. These results open a question about the behavior of the Standard Model of particles very near the horizon of a black hole where the interactions turn out to be switched off and the electroweak symmetry could be restored.

    "abstract": "  We introduce a new asymptotic ansatz for spherical perturbations of the Standard Model of Cosmology (SM) which applies during the $p=0$ epoch, and prove that these perturbations trigger instabilities in the SM on the scale of the supernova data. These instabilities create a large, central region of uniform under-density which expands faster than the SM, and this central region of accelerated uniform expansion introduces into the SM {\\it precisely} the same range of corrections to redshift vs luminosity as are produced by the cosmological constant in the theory of Dark Energy. A universal behavior is exhibited because all sufficiently small perturbations evolve to a single stable rest point. Moreover, we prove that these perturbations are consistent with, and the instability is triggered by, the one parameter family of self-similar waves which the authors previously proposed as possible time-asymptotic wave patterns for perturbations of the SM at the end of the radiation epoch. Using numerical simulations, we calculate the unique wave in the family that accounts for the same values of the Hubble constant and quadratic correction to redshift vs luminosity as in a universe with seventy percent Dark Energy, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}\\approx.7$. A numerical simulation of the third order correction associated with that unique wave establishes a testable prediction that distinguishes this theory from the theory of Dark Energy. This explanation for the anomalous acceleration, based on instabilities in the SM together with simple wave perturbations from the radiation epoch that trigger them, provides perhaps the simplest mathematical explanation for the anomalous acceleration of the galaxies that does not invoke Dark Energy.

The evolution of modified holographic Ricci dark energy's state parameter and the evolution of dark matter and dark energy's densities shows that the dark energy holds the dominant position from the near past to the future. By studying the statefinder diagnostic and the evolution of the total pressure, one can find that this model could explain the Universe's transition from the radiation to accelerating expansion stage through the dust stage. According to the $Om$ diagnostic, it is easy to find that when the interaction is weak and the proportion of relativistic dark matter in total dark matter is small, this model is phantom-like.

This problem is an open discussion topic in modern physics. One of the most common approaches is that of the \"Dark Energy\" (DE), a matter component still unknown, with repulsive character (to explain the accelerated expansion), which fills about 2/3 of the total content of the Universe. In this thesis are investigated two cosmological models, a non-minimally coupled quintessence field, based on a Scalar-Tensor Theory of gravity, formulated in the Einstein's frame, and a quintom dark energy model, based on General Relativity. A normalization and parametrization procedure is introduced for each model, in order to investigate the flow properties of an associated autonomous system of ordinary differential equations. In our study are combined topological, analytical and numerical techniques. We are mainly interested in the past dynamics. However, some results concerning the intermediate and future dynamics are discussed. The mathematical results obtained have an immediate interpretation in the cosmological context. ",

The set of these transformations has the structure of an infinite dimensional Lie group, called the Galilean line group, which contains as a subgroup the Galilei group. We show that the fictitious forces of noninertial reference frames are naturally encoded in the Cartan connection transformed under the Galilean line group. These noninertial forces, which are coordinate effects, do not contribute to the Ricci tensor which describes the curvature of Newtonian spacetime. We show that only the $00$-component of the Ricci tensor is non-zero and equal to ($4\\pi$ times) the matter density in any inertial or noninetial reference frame and that it leads to what may be called Newtonian ADM mass. While the Ricci field equation and Gauss law are both fulfilled by the same physical matter density in inertial and linearly accelerating reference frames, there appears a discrepancy between the two in rotating reference frames in that Gauss law holds for an effective mass density that differs from the physical matter density. This effective density has its origin in the simulated magnetic field that appears in rotating frames, highlighting a rather striking difference between linearly and rotationally accelerating reference frames. We further show that the dynamical equations that govern the simulated gravitational and magnetic fields have the same form as Maxwell's equations, a surprising conclusion given that these equations are well-known to obey special relativity (and $U(1)$-gauge symmetry), rather than Galilean symmetry.

This new way (if implemented) provides higher accuracy in determining of the black hole mass. Also these features in the spectrum can be used for determine of the certain characteristics in the black hole magnetosphere or in the accretion disk characteristics around the black hole. It is also shown that the asymptotic behavior of this spectrum (at high frequencies) is practically independent from the impact parameter of the falling dipole. ",

    "abstract": "  This is the second lecture of `RAGtime' series on electrodynamical effects near black holes. We will summarize the basic equations of relativistic electrodynamics in terms of spin-coefficient (Newman-Penrose) formalism. The aim of the lecture is to present important relations that hold for exact electro-vacuum solutions and to exhibit, in a pedagogical manner, some illustrative solutions and useful approximation approaches. First, we concentrate on weak electromagnetic fields and we illustrate their structure by constructing the magnetic and electric lines of force. Gravitational field of the black hole assumes axial symmetry, whereas the electromagnetic field may or may not share the same symmetry. With these solutions we can investigate the frame-dragging effects acting on electromagnetic fields near a rotating black hole. These fields develop magnetic null points and current sheets. Their structure suggests that magnetic reconnection takes place near the rotating black hole horizon. Finally, the last section will be devoted to the transition from test-field solution to exact solutions of coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. New effects emerge within the framework of exact solutions: the expulsion of the magnetic flux out of the black-hole horizon depends on the intensity of the imposed magnetic field. ",

    "abstract": "  The LISA Pathfinder mission will demonstrate the technology of drag-free test masses for use as inertial references in future space-based gravitational wave detectors. To accomplish this, the Pathfinder spacecraft will perform drag-free flight about a test mass while measuring the acceleration of this primary test mass relative to a second reference test mass. Because the reference test mass is contained within the same spacecraft, it is necessary to apply forces on it to maintain its position and attitude relative to the spacecraft. These forces are a potential source of acceleration noise in the LISA Pathfinder system that are not present in the full LISA configuration. While LISA Pathfinder has been designed to meet it's primary mission requirements in the presence of this noise, recent estimates suggest that the on-orbit performance may be limited by this `suspension noise'. The drift-mode or free-flight experiments provide an opportunity to mitigate this noise source and further characterize the underlying disturbances that are of interest to the designers of LISA-like instruments. This article provides a high-level overview of these experiments and the methods under development to analyze the resulting data. ",

We consider the extension of the theorem to the magnetohydrodynamic regime, under the assumption of an infinitely conductive fluid, both in the Newtonian and in the relativistic framework. When the magnetic field is toroidal, the conditions required by the theorem are equivalent to integrability conditions, as it is the case for purely hydrodynamic flows. When the magnetic field is poloidal, the analysis for the relativistic regime is substantially different with respect to the Newtonian case and additional constraints, in the form of PDEs, must be imposed on the magnetic field in order to guarantee that the angular velocity $\\Omega$ depends only on the specific angular momentum $\\ell$. In order to deduce such physical constraints, it is crucial to adopt special coordinates, which are adapted to the $\\Omega={\\rm const}$ surfaces. The physical significance of these results is briefly discussed. ",

The associated background metric tensor and gauge field represent an exact four-dimensional solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations with a negative cosmological constant and a non-trivial spacetime topology. As usual, for any charged black hole, a perturbation in the background electromagnetic field induces a metric perturbation and vice versa. In spite of this coupling and the non-vanishing angular momentum, we show that, in the Newman-Penrose formalism, and in the presence of sources, the linearization of the field equations leads to a pair of second-order complex equations for suitable combinations of the spin coefficients, the Weyl and the Maxwell scalars. Then, we generalize the Chandrasekhar transformation theory by the inclusion of source terms and apply it to reduce the perturbation problem to four decoupled inhomogeneous wave equations --- a pair for each sector of perturbations. The radial part of such wave equations can be put into Schrodinger-like forms after Fourier transforming them with respect to time. We find that the resulting effective potentials form two pairs of supersymmetric partner potentials and, as a consequence, the fundamental variables of one perturbation sector are related to the variables of the other sector.

The KS representation is a generalization of the representation underlying Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) which supports, in addition to the usual LQG operators, the action of `background exponential operators' which are connection dependent operators labelled by `background' $su(2)$ electric fields. KS states have, in addition to the LQG state label corresponding to 1 dimensional excitations of the triad, a label corresponding to a `background' electric field which describes 3 dimensional excitations of the triad. Asymptotic behaviour in quantum theory is controlled through asymptotic conditions on the background electric fields which label the {\\em states} and the background electric fields which label the {\\em operators}. Asymptotic conditions on the triad are imposed as conditions on the background electric field state label while confining the LQG spin net graph labels to compact sets. We show that KS states can be realised as wave functions on a quantum configuration space of generalized connections and that the asymptotic behaviour of each such generalized connection is determined by that of the background electric fields which label the background exponential operators. Similar to the spatially compact case, the Gauss Law and diffeomorphism constraints are then imposed through Group Averaging techniques to obtain a large sector of gauge invariant states. It is shown that this sector supports a unitary action of the group of asymptotic rotations and translations and that, as anticipated by Friedman and Sorkin, for appropriate spatial topology, this sector contains states which display fermionic behaviour under $2\\pi$ rotations.

For example, this happens in the case of pure dust matter, for which the pressure vanishes and also in the case of standard dark matter phenomenology. Assuming a finite non-zero pressure, the corresponding dynamics is richer than one naively would expect. In particular, it can be considered as a unified description of dark energy and dark matter. We first consider the more general thermodynamic properties of this class of fluids finding the important result that for them adiabatic and isothermal processes should coincide. We therefore study their behaviors in curved space-times where local thermal equilibrium can be appealed. Thus, we show that this dark fluid degenerates with the dark sector of the LCDM model only in the case of adiabatic evolution. We demonstrate that, adding dissipative processes, a phantom behavior can occur and finally we further highlight that an arbitrary decomposition of the dark sector, into ad hoc dark matter and dark energy terms, may give rise to phantom dark energy, whereas the whole dark sector remains non-phantom.

We recall how these observables can be computed when the travel time of a light ray is known as a function of the positions of the emitter and the receiver for a given instant of reception (or emission). For a long time, such a function--called a reception (or emission) time transfer function--has been almost exclusively calculated by integrating the null geodesic equations describing the light rays. However, other methods avoiding such an integration have been considerably developped in the last twelve years. We give a survey of the analytical results obtained with these new methods up to the third order in the gravitational constant $G$ for a mass monopole. We briefly discuss the case of quasi-conjunctions, where higher-order enhanced terms must be taken into account for correctly calculating the effects. We summarize the results obtained at the first order in $G$ when the multipole structure and the motion of an axisymmetric body is taken into account. We present some applications to on-going or future missions like Gaia and Juno.

Simple models of entanglement predict coherent fluctuations in position of massive bodies, of Planck scale origin, measurable on a laboratory scale, and may account for the fact that the information density of long lived position states in Standard Model fields, which is determined by the strong interactions, is the same as that determined holographically by the cosmological constant.

    "abstract": "  We study evolution of frequency of a standing electromagnetic (EM) wave in a resonant optical cavity placed to the expanding manifold described by the Robertson-Walker metric. One builds a local coordinate system in which spacetime is locally Minkowskian. However, due to the conformal nature of the Robertson-Walker metric the conventional transformation to the local inertial coordinates introduces ambiguity in the physical interpretation of the local time coordinate. Therefore, contrary to a common-sense expectation, a straightforward implementation of EEP alone does not allow us to decide whether atomic clocks ticks at the same rate as the clocks based on EM modes of a cavity. To resolve the ambiguity we analyzed the cavity rigidity and the oscillation of its EM modes in an expanding universe by employing the Maxwell equations. We found out that both the size of the cavity and the EM frequency experience an adiabatic drift in conformal coordinates as the universe expands. We set up the oscillation equation for the EM modes, solve it by the WKB approximation, and reduce the coordinate-dependent quantities to their counterparts measured by a local observer who counts time with atomic clock. The solution shows that there is a perfect cancellation of the adiabatic drift of cavity's frequency by the transformation to local coordinates, and the time counted by the clocks based on EM modes of cavity has the same rate as that of atomic clocks. We conclude that there should be no cosmological drift of frequency of a standing EM wave oscillating in the cavity resonator as compared to the frequency of atomic clocks. Continuous comparison of the frequency of the optical cavity resonator against that of atomic clock yields a powerful null test of the local isotropy of the Hubble expansion and the Einstein equivalence principle in cosmology.

    "abstract": "  This work explores a classical mechanical theory under two further assumptions: (a) there is a universal dry friction force (Aristotelian mechanics), and (b) the variation of the mass of a body due to wear is proportional to the work done by the friction force on the body (Reye's hypothesis). It is shown that mass depends on velocity as in Special Relativity, and that the velocity is constant for a particular characteristic value. In the limit of vanishing friction the theory satisfies a relativity principle as bodies do not decelerate and, therefore, the absolute frame becomes unobservable. However, the limit theory is not Newtonian mechanics, with its Galilei group symmetry, but rather Special Relativity. This result suggests to regard Special Relativity as the limit of a theory presenting universal friction and exchange of mass-energy with a reservoir (vacuum). Thus, quite surprisingly, Special Relativity follows from the absolute space (ether) concept and could have been discovered following studies of Aristotelian mechanics and friction. We end the work confronting the full theory with observations. It predicts the Hubble law through tired light, and hence it is incompatible with supernova light curves unless both mechanisms of tired light (locally) and universe expansion (non-locally) are at work. It also nicely accounts for some challenging numerical coincidences involving phenomena under low acceleration. ",

Two pleasant side effects of this construction are that vacuum energy is completely sequestered from the cosmological constant problem, much like in unimodular gravity, and the natural foliation provided by the time variable defines a sensible solution to the measure problem.

We consider the Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) model as a dynamical dark energy scenario with a slowly time-varying equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w_{\\rm de}$ in order to evaluate the effects of the dark energy component on structure formation in the universe. We first calculate the evolution of density perturbations in the linear regime for both phantom and quintessence behavior of the HDE model and compare the results with standard Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) and $\\Lambda$CDM models. We then calculate the evolution of two characterizing parameters in the spherical collapse model, i.e., the linear density threshold $\\delta_{\\rm c}$ and the virial overdensity parameter $\\Delta_{\\rm vir}$. We show that in HDE cosmologies the growth factor $g(a)$ and the linear overdensity parameter $\\delta_{\\rm c}$ fall behind the values for a $\\Lambda$CDM universe while the virial overdensity $\\Delta_{\\rm vir}$ is larger in HDE models than in the $\\Lambda$CDM model. We also show that the ratio between the radius of the spherical perturbations at the virialization and turn-around time is smaller in HDE cosmologies than that predicted in a $\\Lambda$CDM universe. Hence the growth of structures starts earlier in HDE models than in $\\Lambda$CDM cosmologies and more concentrated objects can form in this case. It has been shown that the non-vanishing surface pressure leads to smaller virial radius and larger virial overdensity $\\Delta_{\\rm vir}$. We compare the predicted number of halos in HDE cosmologies and find out that in general this value is smaller than for $\\Lambda$CDM models at higher redshifts and we compare different mass function prescriptions.

    "abstract": "  The appearance of the inertial vacuum state in Rindler frame has been extensively studied in the literature, both from the point of view of QFT developed using Rindler foliation and using the response of an Unruh-Dewitt Detector (UDD). In comparison, less attention has been devoted to the study of inertial non-vacuum states when viewed from the Rindler frame. We provide a comprehensive study of this issue in this paper. We first present a general formalism describing characterization of an arbitrary inertial state when described using (i) an arbitrary foliation and (ii) the response of UDD moving along an arbitrary trajectory. We use this formalism to explicitly compute the results for the Rindler frame and uniformly accelerated detectors. Any arbitrary inertial state will always have a thermal component in the Rindler frame with additional contributions arising from the non-vacuum nature of the inertial state. We classify the nature of the additional contributions in terms of functions characterizing the inertial state. We establish that for all physically well behaved normalizable inertial states, the correction terms decay with the energy of the Rindler mode so that the high frequency limit is dominated by the thermal noise. However, inertial states which are not strictly normalizable, lead to a constant contribution at all high frequencies in the Rindler frame. A similar behavior arises in the response of the UDD as well. In the case of the detector response, we provide a physical interpretation for the constant contribution at high frequencies in terms of total detection rate of co-moving inertial detectors. We discuss two different approaches for defining a transition rate for the UDD, when the two-point function lacks the time translation invariance and discuss several features of different definitions of transition rates. The implications are discussed. ",

The model explains the accelerating expansion (inflation) in the early universe (the domain of comparatively small values of quantum numbers) and a later transition from the decelerating expansion to the accelerating expansion of the universe (the domain of the very large values of quantum numbers) from a single approach.

In addition to these, and owing to the fact that the cosmological evolution of collisional and non-collisional matter universes, when quantified in terms of the Hubble parameter and the effective equation of states parameters, is very much alike, we further scrutinize the cosmological evolution study by extending the analysis to the study of matter perturbations in the matter domination era. We quantify this analysis in terms of the growth factor of matter perturbations, in which case the resulting picture of the cosmological evolution is clear, since collisional and non-collisional universes can be clearly distinguished. Interestingly enough, since it is known that the oscillations of the effective equation of state parameter around the phantom divide are undesirable and unwanted in $F(R)$ gravities, when these are considered for redshifts near the matter domination era and before, in the curvature corrected exponential model with collisional matter which we study here there exist oscillations that never cross the phantom divide.

    "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce a noncommutative version of the Brans-Dicke (BD) theory and obtain the Hamiltonian equations of motion for a spatially flat Friedmann--Lema\\^{\\i}tre--Robertson--Walker universe filled with a perfect fluid. We focus on the case where the scalar potential as well as the ordinary matter sector are absent. Then, we investigate gravity-driven acceleration and kinetic inflation in this noncommutative BD cosmology. In contrast to the commutative case, in which the scale factor and BD scalar field are in a power-law form, in the noncommutative case the power-law scalar factor is multiplied by a dynamical exponential warp factor. This warp factor depends on the noncommutative parameter as well as the momentum conjugate associated to the BD scalar field. We show that the BD scalar field and the scale factor effectively depend on the noncommutative parameter. For very small values of this parameter, we obtain an appropriate inflationary solution, which can overcome problems within BD standard cosmology in a more efficient manner. Furthermore, a graceful exit from an early acceleration epoch towards a decelerating radiation epoch is provided. For late times, due to the presence of the noncommutative parameter, we obtain a zero acceleration epoch, which can be interpreted as the coarse-grained explanation. ",

The frequencies of slowly rotating, barotropic, and non-magnetic Newtonian stars are well known, but subject to various corrections. After making simple estimates of the relative strengths of these corrections we conclude that relativistic corrections are likely to be the most important. For this reason we extend the formalism of K. H. Lockitch, J. L. Friedman, and N. Andersson [Phys. Rev. D 68, 124010 (2003)], who consider relativistic polytropes, to the case of realistic equations of state. This formulation results in perturbation equations which are solved using a spectral method. We find that for realistic equations of state the r-mode frequency ranges from 1.39 to 1.57 times the spin frequency of the star when the relativistic compactness parameter (M/R) is varied over the astrophysically motivated interval 0.11 to 0.31. The results presented here are relevant to the design of gravitational wave and electromagnetic r-mode searches, and following a successful r-mode detection could help constrain the high density equation of state.

CMB observations so far have only constrained the tensor-scalar ratio $r$, but not $n_t$ nor $\\alpha_t$. Complementary to this, the ground-based interferometric detectors working at $\\sim 10^2$Hz are able to constrain the spectral indices that influence the spectrum sensitively at high frequencies. In this work we give a proper normalization of the analytical spectrum at the low frequency end, yielding a modification by a factor of $\\sim 1/50$ to the previous treatment. We calculate the signal-noise ratios (SNR) for various ($n_t,\\alpha_t$) at fixed $r=0.2$ by S6 of LIGO H-L, and obtain the observational upper limit on the running index $\\alpha_t<0.02093$ (i.e, at a detection rate $95\\%$ and a false alarm rate $5\\%$) at the default $(n_t=0,r=0.2)$. This is consistent with the constraint on the energy density obtained by LIGO-Virgo Collaboration. Extending to the four correlated detectors currently running, the calculated SNR improves slightly. When extending to the six correlated detectors of the second-generation in design, the calculated SNR is $\\sim 10^3$ times over the previous two cases, due to the high sensitivities.

Four dimensional cosmological solutions are obtained assuming the equation of state $p=\\omega \\rho$. For a positive value of $\\lambda $ (a parameter in the theory) the solution is singular (of big-bang type) but may have accelerated expansion at an early stage. For $\\lambda<0$ there exists a non-zero minimum scale factor and a finite maximum value of the energy density, but the curvature scalar diverges. Interestingly, for $\\lambda <0$, the universe may undergo an eternal accelerated expansion with a de Sitter expansion phase at late times. We find these features without considering any extra matter field or even negative pressure. Fitting our model with Supernova data we find that the simplest dust model ($p=0$), with $\\lambda >0$, is able to generate acceleration and fits well, although the resulting properties of the universe differ much from the known, present day, accepted values. The best fit model requires (with $\\lambda > 0$) an additional component of the physical matter density, with a negative value of the equation of state parameter, along with dust. The $\\lambda < 0$ solutions do not fit well with observations. Though these models do not explain the dark energy problem with consistency, their analysis does shed light on the plausibility of an alternative geometrical explanation. ",

    "abstract": "  Searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) using terrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs of detectors. The sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, among other things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller the separation, the better the sensitivity. Hence, a co-located detector pair is more sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-located detector pair. However, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer from correlated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that could contaminate the measurement of the background. Hence, methods to identify and mitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potential increase in sensitivity of co-located detectors. Here we report on the first SGWB analysis using the two LIGO Hanford detectors and address the complications arising from correlated environmental noise. We apply correlated noise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two LIGO Hanford detectors, H1 and H2, during LIGO's fifth science run. At low frequencies, 40 - 460 Hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlated noise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochastic gravitational-wave signal. However, at high frequencies, 460-1000 Hz, these techniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (C.L.) upper limit on the gravitational-wave energy density of \\Omega(f)<7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 Hz)^3, which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\\sim 180$. In doing so, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches using advanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields) may affect even widely separated detectors.

A targeted search for gravitational wave compact binary merger signals in coincidence with short GRBs was developed and used to analyze data from the first generation LIGO and Virgo instruments. In this paper, we present improvements to this search that enhance our ability to detect gravitational wave counterparts to short GRBs. Specifically, we introduce an improved method for estimating the gravitational wave background to obtain the event significance required to make detections; implement a method of tiling extended sky regions, as required when searching for signals associated to poorly localized GRBs from Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor or the InterPlanetary Network; and incorporate astrophysical knowledge about the beaming of GRB emission to restrict the search parameter space. We describe the implementation of these enhancements and demonstrate how they improve the ability to observe binary merger gravitational wave signals associated with short GRBs. ",

This theory is composed of three coupled scalars ($\\phi_p,p=1,2,3$) to give a sixth-order derivative scalar theory for $\\phi_3$, in addition to tensor. Recovering the power spectra between scalars from the LCFT correlators in momentum space indicates that the de Sitter/logarithmic conformal field theory (dS/LCFT) correspondence works in the superhorizon limit. We use LCFT correlators derived from the dS/LCFT differentiate dictionary to compare cosmological correlators (power spectra) and find also LCFT correlators by making use of extrapolate dictionary. This is because the former approach is more conventional than the latter. A bulk version dual to the truncation process to find a unitary CFT in the LCFT corresponds to selecting a physical field $\\phi_2$ with positive norm propagating on the dS spacetime. ",

Our analysis is done in the framework of teleparallel equivalent of general relativity which is based on torsion instead of curvature. We show that in our model there exists a late-time scaling attractor (point $P_{4}$), corresponding to an accelerating universe with the property that dark energy and dark matter densities are of the same order. Such a point can help to alleviate the cosmological coincidence problem. Existence of this point is the most significant difference between our model and another model in which a canonical scalar field (quintessence) is used instead of tachyon field. ",

    "abstract": "  We show that the general relativistic theory of the dynamics of isotropic stellar clusters can be developed essentially along the same lines as the Newtonian theory. We prove that the distribution function can be derived from any isotropic momentum moment and that every higher-order moment of the distribution can be written as an integral over a zeroth-order moment.   We propose a mathematically simple expression for the distribution function of a family of isotropic general relativistic cluster models and investigate their dynamical properties. In the Newtonian limit, these models obtain a distribution function of the form F(E) ~ (E-E_0)^alpha, with E binding energy and E_0 a constant that determines the model's outer radius. The slope alpha sets the steepness of the distribution function and the corresponding radial density and pressure profiles. We show that the field equations only yield solutions with finite mass for alpha<3.5. Moreover, in the limit alpha->3.5, only Newtonian models exist. In other words: within the context of this family of models, no general relativistic version of the Plummer model exists. The most strongly bound model within the family is characterized by alpha=2.75 and a central redshift z_c~0.55. ",

As it is well known, this approach strays from the framework of General Relativity since it results in theories in which torsion can be present. An important point of our approach is that the solutions obtained explicitly carry topological information of the considered space-time manifold. We consider here all the characteristic classes that are consistent with a space-time manifold leading to the definition of an 'effective Cosmological Constant' that inherits topological information. We present analytical solutions for the contortion $1$-form that can be obtained under general conditions in various cases of interest. We show how to use these solutions to study cosmological scenarios that are obtained mainly by selecting a metric and an ideal fluid. We also discuss some of the consequences of these cosmological models over the topological and differential structure of the space-time manifold considered. ",

The combined effects of the gravity fields of the Earth, the Sun and the Moon make the three satellites deviate from their nominally stationary, equatorial and equilateral configuration. Since changes in the satellites relative distances and orientations could negatively affect the precision of the laser heterodyne measurements, we have derived the time-dependence of the inter-satellite distances and velocities, the variations of the polar angles made by the constellation's three arms with respect to a chosen reference frame, and the time changes of the triangle's enclosed angles. We find that, during the time between two consecutive station-keeping maneuvers (about two weeks), the relative variations of the inter-satellite distances do not exceed a value of $0.05$ percent, while the relative velocities between pairs of satellites remain smaller than about $0.7 \\ {\\rm m/s}$. In addition, we find the angles made by the arms of the triangle with the equatorial plane to be periodic functions of time whose amplitudes grow linearly with time; the maximum variations experienced by these angles as well as by those within the triangle remain smaller than $3$ arc-minutes, while the East-West angular variations of the three arms remain smaller than about $15$ arc-minutes during the two-weeks period. The relatively small variations of these orbit parameters result into a set of system functional and performance requirements that are less stringent than those characterizing an interplanetary mission.

To achieve the required level of disturbance free-fall onboard these large and heavy platforms we propose a \"two-stage\" drag-free system, which incorporates the Modular Gravitational Reference Sensor (MGRS) (developed at Stanford University) and does not rely on the use of micro-Newton thrusters. Although both mission concepts are characterized by different technical and programmatic challenges, individually they could be flown and operated at a cost significantly lower than those of previously envisioned gravitational wave missions. We estimate both mission concepts to cost less than 500M US$ each, and in the year 2015 we will perform at JPL a detailed selecting mission cost analysis. ",

To illustrate the capabilities of our methods we apply them to two different types of numerically-simulated gravitational wave signals, namely bursts produced from the core collapse of rotating stars and waveforms from binary black hole mergers. We explore the parameter space of the methods to find the set of values best suited for denoising gravitational wave signals under different conditions such as waveform type and signal-to-noise ratio. Our results show that noise from gravitational wave signals can be successfully removed with our techniques, irrespective of the signal morphology or astrophysical origin. We also combine our methods with spectrograms and show how those can be used simultaneously with other common techniques in gravitational wave data analysis to improve the chances of detection. ",

We examine the case of a 6:1 mass ratio system in inspiral close to merger, where the star is governed by a polytropic $\\Gamma=2$, an SLy, or an LS220 equation of state. In particular, we are able to obtain a solution with a realistic LS220 equation of state for a star with compactness 0.26 and mass 1.98 $M_\\odot$, which is representative of the highest reliably determined neutron star masses. For the SLy equation of state, we can obtain solutions with a comparable compactness of 0.25, while for a family of polytropic equations of state, we obtain solutions with compactness up to 0.21, the largest compactness that is stable in this family. These compactness values are significantly higher than any previously published results. We find that improvements in adapting the computational domain to the neutron star surface and in accounting for the center of mass drift of the system are the key ingredients allowing us to obtain these solutions.

Recalling that black hole thermal properties are connected to the non-classical nature of gravity, we circumvent the restrictions of the no hair theorem by postulating that the black hole interior is singularity free due to violations of the usual energy conditions. Further these conditions allow one to establish a one-to-one, holographic projection between Planckian areal \"bits\" on the horizon and \"voxels\", representing the gravitational degrees of freedom in the black hole interior. We illustrate the repercussions of this idea by discussing an example of the black hole interior consisting of a de Sitter core postulated to arise from the local graviton quantum vacuum energy.

We find an upper limit of $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}<1.2\\times 10^{5}$, which is three orders of magnitude smaller than a similar analysis of a global network of broadband seismometers on Earth and the best limits in this band to date. We also discuss the benefits of a potential Earth-Moon correlation search and compute the time-dependent overlap reduction function required for such an analysis. For this search, we find an upper limit an order of magnitude larger than the Moon-Moon search. ",

    "abstract": "  ASTROD-GW (ASTROD [Astrodynamical Space Test of Relativity using Optical Devices] optimized for Gravitational Wave detection) is a gravitational-wave mission with the aim of detecting gravitational waves from massive black holes, extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and galactic compact binaries, together with testing relativistic gravity and probing dark energy and cosmology. Mission orbits of the 3 spacecrafts forming a nearly equilateral triangular array are chosen to be near the Sun-Earth Lagrange points L3, L4 and L5. The 3 spacecrafts range interferometrically with one another with arm length about 260 million kilometers. For 260 times longer arm length, the detection sensitivity of ASTROD-GW is 260 fold better than that of eLISA/NGO in the lower frequency region by assuming the same acceleration noise. Therefore, ASTROD-GW will be a better cosmological probe. In previous papers, we have worked out the time delay interferometry (TDI) for the ecliptic formation. To resolve the reflection ambiguity about the ecliptic plane in source position determination, we have changed the basic formation into slightly inclined formation with half-year precession-period. In this paper, we optimize a set of 10-year inclined ASTROD-GW mission orbits numerically using ephemeris framework starting at June 21, 2035, including cases of inclination angle is 0{\\deg} (no inclination), 0.5{\\deg}, 1.0{\\deg}, 1.5{\\deg}, 2.0{\\deg}, 2.5{\\deg} and 3.0{\\deg}. We simulate the time delays of the first and second generation TDI configurations for the different inclinations, and compare/analyse the numerical results to attain the requisite sensitivity of ASTROD-GW by suppressing laser frequency noise below the secondary noises. To explicate our calculation process for different inclination cases, we take the 1.0{\\deg} as example to show the orbit optimization and TDI simulation. ",

In particular, after taking into account the role of the two main objects of relativistic theories of gravity, i.e. the metric and the connection fields, we consider the possibility that they are not trivially related so that the geodesic structure and the causal structure of the spacetime could be disentangled, as supposed in the Palatini formulation of gravity. In this perspective, the Equivalence Principle, in its weak and strong formulations, can play a fundamental role in discriminating among competing theories. The possibility of its violation at quantum level could open new perspectives in gravitational physics and in unification with other interactions. We shortly debate the possibility of equivalence principle measurements by ground-based and space experiments. ",

    "abstract": "  Many different forms of the de Sitter metric in different coordinate systems are used in the general relativity literature. Two of them are the most common, the static form and the cosmological (exponentially expanding) form. The staticity and non-stationarity of these two different forms are traced back to the noncomoving and comoving nature of the corresponding coordinate systems. In this paper using the quasi-Maxwell form of the Einstein field equations and a definition of static spacetimes based upon them, we look at these two different forms of the same solution from a new perspective which classifies them as a special case in a general one-parameter family of solutions. Specifically it is proved that, {\\it irrespective of the spacetime symmetry, a one-element perfect fluid in any frame noncomoving with the fluid could be the source of a static spacetime, only if its equation of state is that of a dark fluid namely $p = -\\rho = const.$}. These static solutions, which include the well-known de Sitter spacetime, are called de Sitter-type spacetimes. To exemplify we consider static axially and cylindrically symmetric de Sitter-type spacetimes and their dynamic (cosmological) versions. It is shown how despite the seemingly natural expectation based on the presence of $\\Lambda$ as their only parameter, the nonspherical expansions of these genuinely different solutions should be expected indeed. To the best of our knowledge the dynamic version of the cylindrically symmetric de Sitter-type spacetime is introduced here for the first time. Finally it is noted that the identification of the geometric term $\\Lambda g_{ij}$ with a perfect fluid with equation of state $p = -\\rho = const.$, although mathematically consistent, obscures the crucial role of the (dark) fluid's velocity in defining a preferred (comoving) coordinate system in de Sitter-type spacetimes.

If we focus on the the weakly self-gravitating and slowly evolving system whose spatial extent is much smaller than the scale of the cosmological horizon in the homogeneous and isotropic background universe model, the cosmological Newtonian approximation is available. Also in the huge void universe model, the same kind of approximation as the cosmological Newtonian approximation is available for the analysis of the perturbations contained in a region whose spatial size is much smaller than the scale of the huge void: the effects of the huge void are taken into account in a perturbative manner by using the Fermi-normal coordinates. By using this approximation, we derive the equations of motion for the weakly self-gravitating perturbations whose elements have relative velocities much smaller than the speed of light, and show the derived equations can be significantly different from those in the homogeneous and isotropic universe model, due to the anisotropic volume expansion in the huge void. We linearize the derived equations of motion and solve them. The solutions show that the behaviors of linear density perturbations are very different from those in the homogeneous and isotropic universe model. ",

    "abstract": "  In this paper canonical quantum gravity on noncommutative space-time is considered. The corresponding generalized classical theory is formulated by using the moyal star product, which enables the representation of the field quantities depending on noncommuting coordinates by generalized quantities depending on usual coordinates. But not only the classical theory has to be generalized in analogy to other field theories. Besides, the necessity arises to replace the commutator between the gravitational field operator and its canonical conjugated quantity by a corresponding generalized expression on noncommutative space-time. Accordingly the transition to the quantum theory has also to be performed in a generalized way and leads to extended representations of the quantum theoretical operators. If the generalized representations of the operators are inserted to the generalized constraints, one obtains the corresponding generalized quantum constraints including the Hamiltonian constraint as dynamical constraint. After considering quantum geometrodynamics under incorporation of a coupling to matter fields, the theory is transferred to the Ashtekar formalism. The holonomy representation of the gravitational field as it is used in loop quantum gravity opens the possibility to calculate the corresponding generalized area operator. ",

A comparison with the $\\Lambda$CDM model was performed. A new feature of the model is the existence of some values of potential coupling constant, leading to a $\\sigma$CDM solution without transit into accelerated expansion epoch. ",

    "abstract": "  The energy content of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole surrounded by quintessence is investigated using approximate Lie symmetry methods. It is mainly done by assuming mass and charge of the black hole as small quantities ($\\epsilon$), and by retaining its second power in the perturbed geodesic equations for such black hole while neglecting its higher powers. Due to the presence of trivial second-order approximate Lie symmetries of these perturbed geodesic equations, a rescaling of the geodetic parameter gives a rescaling of the energy in this black hole. Interestingly we obtain an explicit relation of the rescaling factor that depends on the square of the charge to mass ratio of the black hole, the normalization factor $\\alpha$, which is related to the state parameter of the quintessence matter, and the coordinate $r$. A comparison of this rescaling factor with that of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole (Hussain et. al SIGMA, 2007), without quintessence is given. It is observed that the presence of the quintessence field reduces the energy in this black hole spacetime. Further it is found that there exists a point outside the event horizon of this black hole where the effect of quintessence balances the energy content in this black hole without quintessence, and where the total energy of the underlying spacetime becomes zero.

    "abstract": "  We suggest to solve for the motion of the two body problem in General Relativity by identifying the leading violation of conserved quantities, referred to as (relativistic) anomalies, ordered by the post-Newtonian order at which they appear. This differs from the standard procedure of obtaining the full solution up to a prescribed order. We find that the reduced Hamiltonian which describes the drift in the space of conserved quantities is given by the average of the perturbation Hamiltonian. Using this approach the averaging is done prior to the derivation of time evolution, thereby economizing the computation. The computations become similar to those in the Hamilton-Jacobi method, while staying in the more comfortable setting of the Hamiltonian formulation. We apply this approach of leading anomalies and the drift Hamiltonian to the binary problem and treat several perturbations: 1PN, spin-orbit and spin-spin. On the way we discuss the interpretation of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector as a generator of scale-preserving conformal transformations in momentum space. ",

The observed energy density in the Unruh state at the future event horizon as seen from a freely falling observer is finite if the observer is released from rest at any positive distance outside the horizon. However, it is only divergent at the horizon in the limit that the observer starts falling from rest at the horizon, which corresponds to the infinite boost with respect to the freely falling observer at a finite distance from the horizon. We point out some differences between the present work and the conventional ones. ",

Furthermore, we study the deviation of the IWM-CFC approximation from full general relativity by evaluating and comparing different error indicators. We find that for the models that are not near the maximum mass, a simple error indicator constructed from local values of the metric potentials is more indicative of the accuracy of the IWM-CFC approximation than an error indicator that is based on the Cotton-York tensor. Furthermore, we construct a simple, linear empirical relation that allows for the estimation of the error made by the IWM-CFC approximation and which only involves the flattening of the star due to rotation and the minimum value of the lapse function. Thus, in any numerical simulation involving rotating relativistic stars, one can readily know the deviations from full general relativity due to the IWM-CFC approximation. ",

Observations of extreme mass ratio inspirals will allow us to explore galactic centers in the local universe, as well as providing tests of General Relativity and constraining the value of Hubble's constant. The detection of compact binaries in our own galaxy may allow us to model stellar evolution in the Milky Way.

The spontaneous transition rates and effective temperature of the atom are examined in detail in the ultrarelativistic limit and are shown to be always larger than those in the linear acceleration case with the same proper acceleration.

We show that when the polar angle in Bloch sphere, $\\theta$, that characterizes the initial state of the atom equals $\\pi/{2}$, the geometric phases acquired due to circular and linear acceleration are the same.

Both Bosonic and Fermionic modes are calculated to construct a reduced density matrix of particles tunnelling out across the accelerated Rindler horizon, giving a thermal spectrum characterized by a temperature proportional to the local acceleration - Unruh temperature. So, we calculate both the spectrum and temperature from within the tunnelling framework.   In another direction, following Utiyama-Sciama-Kibble, we localise the Poincare group to obtain a Poincare gauge theory (PGT) of gravity. It had been pointed before in the literature, that the Poincare symmetries seemed to be recoverable canonically only on-shell. This would however mean existence of two independent sets of symmetries, each by itself having number of gauge parameters equal to the Poincare group, implying an apparent doubling of symmetries. To resolve this, we first start by a constraint analysis and construct the first-class gauge generator through an explicitly off-shell algorithm. We investigate both the Mielke-Baekler 3d model and a PGT formulation of New-Massive gravity. Next, we carefully study the symmetries and corresponding Noether identities to show that the difference between the two sets is a `trivial symmetry.' These is a transformation of fields that is not a true gauge symmetry as it gives rise to no new gauge degeneracy in defining physical states. ",

The inverse Gertsenshtein conversion of gravitational waves in a static electromagnetic field is rederived, and the resultant electromagnetic radiation is shown to be significant for highly magnetised pulsars in compact binary systems. We also obtain a variety of nonlinear interference effects for interacting gravitational and electromagnetic waves, although wave-wave resonances previously described in the literature are absent when the electric-magnetic self-interaction is taken into account.

    "abstract": "  In this work we have studied the nonlinear preheating dynamics of the $\\frac{1}{4} \\lambda \\phi^4$ inflationary model. It is well established that after a linear stage of preheating characterized by the parametric resonance, the nonlinear dynamics becomes relevant driving the system towards turbulence. Wave turbulence is the appropriated description of this phase since matter distributions are fields instead of usual fluids. Therefore, turbulence develops due to the nonlinear interations of waves, here represented by the small inhomogeneities of the inflaton field. We present relevant aspects of wave turbulence such as the Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum in frequency and wave number domains that indicates that there are a transfer of energy through scales. From the power spectrum of the matter energy density we were able to estimate the temperature of the thermalized system. ",

    "abstract": "  The hydrodynamic behaviour of perfect fluid orbiting around black holes in spherically symmetric spacetime for various alternative gravity theories has been investigated. For this purpose we have assumed an uniform distribution for the angular momentum density of the rotating perfect fluid. The contours of equipotential surfaces are illustrated in order to obtain the nature of inflow and outflow of matters. It has been noticed that, the marginally stable circular orbits originating from decreasing angular momentum density lead to closed equipotential surfaces along with cusp allowing existence of accretion disks. On the other hand, the growing part of angular momentum density exhibits central rings for which stable configurations are possible. However inflow of matter is prohibited. Among the solutions discussed in this work, the charged $F(R)$ gravity and Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet solution exhibit inflow and outflow of matter with central rings present. These varied accretion disk structure of perfect fluid attribute these spacetimes astrophysical importance. The effect of higher curvature terms predominantly arises from region near the black hole horizon. Hence the structural difference of accretion disk in modified gravity theories with comparison to general relativity may act as an experimental probe for these alternative gravity theories. ",

The gas is described by a one-particle distribution function which satisfies the Liouville equation and is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic. Making use of the isometries of the spacetime, we define precisely the homogeneity and isotropicity property of the distribution function, and based on this definition we give a concise derivation of the most general family of such distribution functions. For this family, we construct the particle current density and the stress-energy tensor and consider the coupled Einstein-Liouville system of equations. We find that as long as the distribution function is collisionless, homogenous and isotropic, the evolution of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe exhibits a singular origin. Its future development depends upon the curvature of the spatial sections: spatially flat or hyperboloid universes expand forever and this expansion dilutes the energy density and pressure of the gas, while a universe with compact spherical sections reaches a maximal expansion, after which it reverses its motion and recollapses to a final crunch singularity where the energy density and isotropic pressure diverge.

Probably the most famous example is Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein (BBMB) black hole solution in a theory with a scalar field conformally coupled to the gravity and with vanishing potential. Its existence naively violates no-hair conjecture without violating no-hair theorems because of the singular behavior of the scalar field at the horizon. Despite being discovered more than 40 years ago, nature of BBMB solution is still the subject of research and debate. We argue here that the key in understanding nature of maverick solutions is the proper choice of field redefinition schemes in which the solutions are regular. It appears that in such \"regular\" schemes mavericks have different physical interpretations, in particular they are not elementary but composite objects. For example, BBMB solution is not an extremal black hole but a collection of a wormhole and a naked singularity.

In this paper, we work out the range observable of the non-dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity for the Satellite-Satellite Tracking measurements. We find out that a characteristic time accumulating range signal appears in the non-dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, which has no analogy found in the standard parity-preserving metric theories of gravity. The magnitude of this Chern-Simons signal will reach to a few times of $\\chi cm$ for each free flight of these SST missions, here $\\chi$ is the dimensionless post-Newtonian parameter of the non-dynamical Chern-Simons theory. Therefore, with the 12 years data of the GRACE mission, one expects that the mass scale $M_{CS}=\\frac{4\\hbar c}{\\chi a}$ of the non-dynamical Chern-Simons gravity will be constrained to be larger than $1.9\\times10^{-9}eV$.

Pulsar timing arrays continue to improve the bounds on gravitational waves at nanohertz frequencies, and may detect a signal on roughly the same timescale as ground-based detectors. The science case for space-based interferometers targeting millihertz sources is very strong. The decade of gravitational-wave discovery is poised to begin.

Consequently, attempts to avoid the violation of the energy conditions constitutes one of the main areas of research in WH physics. On the other hand, the current literature shows us that noncommutativity is one of the most promising candidates to help us to understand the physics of the early Universe. However, since noncommutativity does not change the commutative results, we also can expect that energy conditions violation near the throat must occur. We will show here that the violation of the energy conditions, described in a noncommutative space-time, has fixed conditions on the angular momentum of a rotating WH with constant angular velocity.

In particular, we assume a coherent emission source near the black hole and investigate the wavefront distortion as seen by a distant observer. Near the observer, the propagating wave can be decomposed using the Laguerre-Gaussian mode basis and its wavefront distortion can be characterized by the decomposition coefficient. We find that this decomposition spectrum is symmetric for wave sources located near a Schwarzschild black hole, but is generically asymmetric if the host black hole is rotating. The spectrum asymmetry, or the net orbital angular momentum carried by the wave, is intimately related to the black hole spin and mass, the wave frequency and the locations of the source and the observer. We present semi-analytical expressions and numerical results for these parameter-dependences. If the radiation is temporally coherent, our results show that the secondary images of the source can be almost as bright as its primary image. In the case of temporally-incoherent radiation, we show that the non-fundamental spectrum components could be resolved by spatially-separated telescopes, although that would be degenerate with the telescope direction. Finally, our results suggest that the black-hole-induced spectrum asymmetry is generally too weak to be observed in radio astronomy, even if the observer were located near a caustic point. ",

We first set up these coordinates in the general case, and then use this to study effective magnetic fields due to gravitational curvature in the exterior and interior Schwarzschild, Janis-Newman-Winicour, and Bertrand space-times. We show that these fields can be large for specific parameter values in the theories, and thus might have observational significance. We discuss the qualitative differences of the magnetic field for vacuum space-times and for those seeded by matter. We estimate the magnitude of these fields in realistic galactic scenarios and discuss their possible experimental relevance. Gravitational curvature corrections to the Hydrogen atom spectrum for these space-times are also discussed briefly. ",

Jacobson has showed that the Einstein equation can be derived from the consideration of this thermodynamic process. This, however, works only if the acceleration $a$ is much larger than the scale set by the curvature of the spacetime. It is explored here whether an extension is possible to the case with no lower bound on $a$. We show that this is possible if one assumes that in a locally accelerating frame, the matter-energy passing through null hypersurfaces could result in an increase in the heat energy and the entropy. Such a generalisation extends the thermodynamic derivation of gravity to include any non-freely falling observer. A new method of determining the temperature detected by such locally accelerating observers is also presented. By considering only the quantisation of sufficiently localised wave modes of a field, it is shown that the observer finds himself in a thermal environment. ",

To be specific, we will study area spectrum of supersymmetric BMPV black holes/black rings and Reissner-Norstroem black holes at the extremal limit.

    "abstract": "  We review and strengthen the arguments given by Einstein to derive his first gravitational field equation for static fields and show that, although it was ultimately rejected, it follows from General Relativity (GR) for negligible pressure. Using this equation and considerations folowing directly from the equivalence principle (EP), we show how Schwarzschild metric and other vacum metrics can be obtained immediately. With this results and some basic principles, we obtain the metric in the general spherically symmetric case and the corresponding hydrostatic equilibrium equation. For this metrics we obtain the motion equations in a simple and exact manner that clearly shows the three sources of difference (implied by various aspects of the EP) with respect to the Newtonian case and use them to study the classical tests of GR. We comment on the origin of the problems of Einstein first theory of gravity and discuss how, by removing it the theory could be made consistent and extended to include rotations, we also comments on various conceptual issues of GR as the origin of the gravitational effect of pressure.

    "abstract": "  We consider a five-dimensional Einstein-Chern-Simons action which is composed of a gravitational sector and a sector of matter, where the gravitational sector is given by a Chern-Simons gravity action instead of the Einstein-Hilbert action and where the matter sector is given by the so called perfect fluid. It is shown that (i) the Einstein-Chern-Simons (EChS) field equations subject to suitable conditions can be written in a similar way to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations; (ii) these equations have solutions that describe accelerated expansion for the three possible cosmological models of the universe, namely, spherical expansion, flat expansion and hyperbolic expansion when $\\alpha $, a parameter of theory, is greater than zero. This result allow us to conjeture that this solutions are compatible with the era of Dark Energy and that the energy-momentum tensor for the field $h^{a}$, a bosonic gauge field from the Chern-Simons gravity action, corresponds to a form of positive cosmological constant.   It is also shown that the EChS field equations have solutions compatible with the era of matter: (i) In the case of an open universe, the solutions correspond to an accelerated expansion ($\\alpha >0$) with a minimum scale factor at initial time that, when the time goes to infinity, the scale factor behaves as a hyperbolic sine function. (ii) In the case of a flat universe, the solutions describing an accelerated expansion whose scale factor behaves as a exponencial function when time grows. \\item In the case of a closed universe it is found only one solution for a universe in expansion, which behaves as a hyperbolic cosine function when time grows.

This general construction is then used to generate an appropriate Hilbert space and observables for the noncommutative theory which, when applied to the Bianchi I Cosmology, leads to a new set of equations that describe the quantum evolution of the universe. We find that this formulation matches theories based on a reticular Heisenberg-Weyl algebra in the bouncing and expanding regions of a collapsing Bianchi universe. There is, however, an additional effect introduced by the dynamics generated by the noncommutativity. This is an oscillation in the spectrum of the volume operator of the universe, within the bouncing region of the commutative theories. We show that this effect is generic and produced by the noncommutative momentum exchange between the degrees of freedom in the cosmology. We give asymptotic and numerical solutions which show the above mentioned effects of the noncommutativity. ",

In a recent technological breakthrough, researchers at NIST have been able to achieve a stability of 1 part in $10^{18}$ using an Ytterbium clock. This naturally raises the question of whether there are fundamental limits to the stability of clocks. In this paper we point out that gravity and quantum mechanics set a fundamental limit on the stability of clocks. This limit comes from a combination of the uncertainty relation, the gravitational redshift and the relativistic time dilation effect. For example, a single ion hydrogen maser clock in a terrestrial gravitational field cannot achieve a stability better than one part in $10^{22}$. This observation has implications for laboratory experiments involving both gravity and quantum theory. ",

    "abstract": "  We reconsider some fundamental problems of the thin shell model. First, we point out that the \"cut and paste\" construction does not guarantee a well-defined manifold because there is no overlap of coordinates across the shell. When one requires that the spacetime metric across the thin shell is continuous, it also provides a way to specify the tangent space and the manifold. Other authors have shown that this specification leads to the conservation laws when shells collide. On the other hand, the well-known areal radius $r$ seems to be a perfect coordinate covering all regions of a spherically symmetric spacetime. However, we show by simple but rigorous arguments that $r$ fails to be a coordinate covering a neighborhood of the thin shell if the metric across the shell is continuous. When two spherical shells collide and merge into one, we show that it is possible that $r$ remains to be a good coordinate and the conservation laws hold. To make this happen, different spacetime regions divided by the shells must be glued in a specific way such that some constraints are satisfied. We compare our new construction with the old one by solving constraints numerically. ",

    "abstract": "  Recently, Harko et al. (2014) derived an approximate metric of the galactic halo in the Eddington inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity.

To quantify different $\\rho _{0}^{\\text{upper}}$ for different samples, we follow the novel approach of Edery & Paranjape (1998), where we use as input the geometric halo radius $R_{\\text{WR}}$ from Weyl gravity and equate it with the dark matter radius $R_{\\text{DM}}$ from EiBI gravity for the same halo boundary. This input then shows that the known fitted values of $\\rho _{0}$ obey the constraint $\\rho_{0}\\leq\\rho_{0}^{\\text{upper}}\\propto $ ($R_{\\text{WR}}$)$^{-2}$. Using the mass-to-light ratios giving $\\alpha $, we shall also evaluate $\\rho _{0}^{\\text{lower}}$ $\\propto $ $(\\alpha -1)M_{\\text{lum}}R_{\\text{WR}}^{-3}$ and the average dark matter density $\\left\\langle \\rho\\right\\rangle ^{\\text{lower}}$. Quantitatively, it turns out that the interval $\\rho _{0}^{\\text{lower}}$ $\\leq \\rho _{0}\\leq $ $\\rho _{0}^{\\text{upper}}$ verifies reasonably well against many dark matter dominated low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies for which values of $\\rho _{0}$ are independently known. The interval holds also in the case of Milky Way galaxy. Qualitatively, the existence of a stability induced upper limit $\\rho _{0}^{\\text{upper}}$ is a remarkable prediction of the EiBI theory. ",

Apart from some explicit assumptions, there are some implicit, like the \"continuity\" of the functions in the perturbed metric across the surface of the body. In this work we sketch the basics for the analysis of the second order problem using the modern theory of perturbed matchings. In particular, the result we present is that when the energy density of the fluid in the static configuration does not vanish at the boundary, one of the functions of the second order perturbation in the setting of the original work by Hartle is not continuous. This discrepancy affects the calculation of the change in mass of the rotating star with respect to the static configuration needed to keep the central energy density unchanged. ",

Such theories smoothly embed general relativity, ensuring recovery of the latter's observational support. When the embedding of spacetime is carried out in accordance with Campbell's theorem, the resulting 5D theory naturally explains the origin of classical matter and vacuum energy. Also, constraints on the equations of motion near a high-energy surface or membrane in the 5D manifold lead to quantization and quantum uncertainty. These are major returns on the modest investment of one extra dimension. Instead of fruitless bickering about whether it is possible to \"see\" the fifth dimension, it is suggested that it be treated on par with other concepts of physics, such as time.

    "abstract": "  Hoyle and Narlikar (HN) in the 1960's developed a theory of gravitation which was completely Machian and used both retarded and advanced waves to communicate gravitational influence between particles. The advanced waves, which travel backward in time, are difficult to visualize and although they are mathematically allowed by relativistic wave equations, they never really caught on. The HN theory reduced to Einstein's theory of gravity in the smooth fluid approximation and a transformation into the rest frame of the fluid. Unfortunately the theory has been ignored by much of the General Relativity community since it was developed with the static universe in mind. However, it is easy to drop the static universe condition (by dropping the \"C\"-field matter creation terms) and then you have a perfectly good theory of gravitation. Hawking in 1965 pointed out a possible flaw in the theory. This involved integrating out into the distant future to account for all the advanced waves which might influence the mass of a particle here and now. Hawking used infinity as his upper time limit and showed the integral was divergent. We would like to point out that since the universe is known to be expanding, and accelerating, the upper limit in the advanced wave time integral should not be infinite but is bounded by the Cosmic Event Horizon. This event horizon $H_e$ represents a barrier between future events that can be observed and those which cannot. We maintain that the advanced integral is in fact finite when the cosmic event horizon is taken into account, since the upper limit of the advanced wave integral becomes $H_e/c$. Hawking's objection is no longer valid and the HN theory becomes a working theory once again. ",

In this regard, we use the teleparallel versions of the Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Bergmann-Thomson, and M$\\ddot{o}$ller prescriptions. The results show that the momentum density components for the Einstein, Bergmann-Thomson, and M$\\ddot{o}$ller prescriptions turn out to be same in all cases of the metrics I, II and III, but are different from those of the Landau- Lifshitz prescription, while the energy components remain the same for these three prescriptions only in all possible cases of the metrics I and II. We mention here that the M$\\ddot{o}$ller energy-momentum distribution is independent of the coupling constant $\\lambda$; that is, these results are valid for any teleparallel models. ",

The associated map between the tangent spaces at two points on a curve is affine, and for this reason, the operation was called \"affine transport\". The map consists of a homogeneous (linear) part given by the parallel transport map along the curve, plus an inhomogeneous part which is related to the development of a curve in a manifold into an affine tangent space (also described as the rolling of a manifold along a tangent space without slipping or twisting). For closed curves, the affine transport equation defines a \"generalized holonomy\". We use covariant bitensor calculus to compute the generalized holonomy around geodesic polygon loops, specifically for triangles and \"parallelogramoids\" with sides formed from geodesic segments. For small loops, we recover the well-known result for the leading-order holonomy of parallel transport ($\\sim$ Riemann $\\times$ area), and we derive the leading-order inhomogeneous part of the generalized holonomy ($\\sim$ Riemann $\\times$ area$^{3/2}$), as well as corrections to both results through order area squared.

The corresponding Bach equation are derived for the special type of metrics, which can be considered as the representative of the general class. The complete set of the pure vacuum solutions is found. It consists of two classes. The first one contains the solutions with constant two-dimensional curvature scalar of our specific metrics, and the representatives are the famous Robertson-Walker metrics. One of them we called the \"gravitational bubbles\", which is compact and with zero Weyl tensor. The second class is more general, with varying curvature scalar. We found its representative as the one-parameter family. It appears that it can be conformally covered by the thee-parameter Mannheim-Kazanas solution. We also investigated the general structure of the energy-momentum tensor in the spherical conformal gravity and constructed the vectorial equation that reveals clearly the same features of non-vacuum solutions. One of them, the metrics a la Vaidya, is explicitly written. ",

This cosmological model can describe radiation dominated early universe and matter dominated late universe in FRW model. Our calculational results show that Einstein gravitational field equations could be derived by the first law of thermodynamics and the fluid's continuity equation. The connections between thermodynamics and gravity are observed in big bounce universe. In the late stages of cold and hot universes, the apparent horizons are convergent and the time when apparent horizons begin to bounce essentially in agreement with that of universe's scalar factor. In the early stage of both cold and hot universes, we find there is only one geometry containing a 4D de Sitter universe with general state parameter. Furthermore, we also find the form of apparent horizon in early universe is strongly dependent on the extra dimension which suggests that the effect of extra dimension could be found in early universe.

The geodesic equation, moreover, shows that our tensor plays a role that is strongly reminiscent of the gravitational field in Newtonian mechanics and this, together with other evidence, which we present, leads us to identify it as the gravitational field tensor.

It turns out that the big bounce and recollapse in the herein model contribute a cyclic scenario for the universe. We then investigate the effects of quantum fields propagating on this cosmological background. By solving the Klein-Gordon equation for a massive and non-minimally coupled scalar field in the primordial region, we study the quantum theory of fields undergoing cosmological evolution towards the late time bounce. By using the exact solutions to describe the quantum fields at early and late time phases we obtain the density of created particles at late time.

To this end we derive the constitutive equations for energy density, isotropic and anisotropic pressure as well as heat-flux from the respective propagation equations. This provides these quantities in closed form, i. e. in terms of the structure constants of the three-dimensional isometry group of homogeneity and, respectively, of the kinematical quantities expansion, rotation and acceleration. Using Einstein's equations, the thereby occurring constants of integration can be determined such that one gets bounds on the kinematical quantities and finds a generalized form of the Friedmann equations. As a consequence, it is shown that, e. g., for a perfect fluid the Friedmann and G\\\"odel models can be recovered. All this is derived without assuming any equations of state or other specific thermodynamic conditions, and, in principle, allows one to go beyond the standard phase cosmology to describe the transition from phase to phase dynamically.

We thus define the notion of tangent boost along a worldline. This notion very general notion gives a useful tool both in special relativity (for non inertial particles or/and for non rectilinear coordinates) and in general relativity. We also introduce a matrix of the Lie algebra which, together with the tangent boost, gives the whole dynamical description of the considered system (acceleration and Thomas rotation). After studying the properties of Lie algebra matrices and of their reduced forms, we show that the Lie group of special Lorentz matrices has four one-parameter subgroups. These tools lead us to introduce the Thomas rotation in a quite general way. At the end of the paper, we present some examples using these tools and we consider the case of an electron rotating on a circular orbit around an atom nucleus. We then discuss the twin paradox and we show that when the one who made a journey into space in a high-speed rocket returns home he is not only younger than the twin who stayed on Earth but he is also disorientated because his gyroscope has turned with respect to earth referential frame.

    "abstract": "  There are a number of reasons to study wormholes with generic cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. Recent observations indicate that present accelerating expansion of the universe demands $\\Lambda>0$. On the other hand, some extended theories of gravitation such as supergravity and superstring theories posses vacuum states with $\\Lambda<0$. Even within the framework of general relativity, a negative cosmological constant permits black holes with horizons topologically different from the usual spherical ones. These solutions are convertible to wormhole solutions by adding some exotic matter. In this paper, the asymptotically flat wormhole solutions in a generic cosmological constant background are studied. By constructing a specific class of shape functions, mass function, energy density and pressure profiles which support such a geometry are obtained. It is shown that for having such a geometry, the wormhole throat $r_0$, the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ and the equation of state parameter $\\omega$ should satisfy two specific conditions. The possibility of setting different values for the parameters of the model helps us to find exact solutions for the metric functions, mass functions and energy-momentum profiles. At last, the volume integral quantifier, which provides useful information about the total amount of energy condition violating matter is discussed briefly. ",

We have constrained the model using the type Ia Supernovae data, evaluated the best estimated values of all the bulk viscous parameters and the Hubble parameter corresponding to the two limiting conditions. We found that even though the evolution of the cosmological parameters are in general different for the two limiting cases, they show identical behavior for the best estimated values of the parameters from both the limiting conditions.

    "abstract": "  In this thesis the universal collapse of vacuum Brill waves is demonstrated numerically and analytically.   This thesis presents the mathematical and numerical methods necessary to regularise and evolve Brill Gravitational Waves in spherical polar coordinates. A Cauchy ADM formulation is used for the time evolution.   We find strong evidence that all IVP formulations of pure vacuum Brill gravitational waves collapse to form singularities/black holes, and we do not observe critical black hole mass scaling phenomena in the IVP parameter phase space that has been characterised in non-vacuum systems. A theoretical framework to prove this result analytically is presented. We discuss the meaning of Brill metric variables, the topology of trapped surfaces for various scenarios, and verify other results in the field related to critical values of initial value parameters and black hole formation approaching spatial infinity.   The instability of Minkowski (flat) space under Brill wave and more general perturbations is demonstrated.   The main numerical tools employed to achieve a stable evolution code are (1) derivation of appropriate regularity conditions on the lapse function and metric function q, (2) the move to a 4th order correct discretisation scheme with appropriate boundary conditions, (3) the use of exponential metric terms, (4) an understanding of the right mix of free versus constrained evolution and (5) the development of appropriate numerical techniques for discretisation and differencing to reduce numerical error, along with a characterisation of condition numbers.

    "abstract": "  We analyse the conservative evolution of spinning compact binaries to second post-Newtonian (2PN) order accuracy, with leading order spin-orbit, spin-spin and mass quadrupole-monopole contributions included. As a main result we derive a closed system of first order differential equations in a compact form, for a set of dimensionless variables encompassing both orbital elements and spin angles. These evolutions are constrained by conservation laws holding at 2PN order. As required by the generic theory of constrained dynamical systems we perform a consistency check and prove that the constraints are preserved by the evolution. We apply the formalism to show the existence of chameleon orbits, whose local, orbital parameters evolve from elliptic (in the Newtonian sense) near pericenter, towards hyperbolic at large distances. This behavior is consistent with the picture that General Relativity predicts stronger gravity at short distances than Newtonian theory does. ",

We assume two perfect fluid components, the matter component has a fixed equation of state (EoS) parameter $\\omega$, while the torsion component has a dynamical EoS. We obtain an effective scale factor allowing a graceful exit inflation model with no need to slow roll technique. We perform a standard cosmological study to examine the cosmic evolution. In addition, the effective EoS shows consistent results confirming a smooth phase transition from inflation to radiation dominant universe. We consider the case when the torsion is made of a scalar field. This treatment enables us to induce a scalar field sensitive to the spacetime symmetry with an effective potential constructed from the quadratic $f(T)$ gravity. The model is parameterized by two parameters ($\\alpha,\\omega$) both derive the universe to exit out of de Sitter expansion. The first is purely gravitational and works effectively at large Hubble regime of the early stage allowing a slow roll potential. The second parameter $\\omega$ is a thermal-like correction coupled to the kinetic term and works effectively at low Hubble regime of late stages. The slow roll analysis of the obtained potential can perform tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index parameters consistent with the recent Planck and BICEP2 data.

    "abstract": "  The early literature on black hole thermodynamics ignored the $P$-$V$ term associated with the existence of a fundamental physical constant in the black hole solution. The inclusion of this constant in the first law becomes inconsistent with the Smarr relation. Once the missing $P$-$V$ term introduced is, it becomes customary to introduce it only in problems where there is a negative cosmological constant. This practice is inherited from cosmological approaches which consider the quantity $-\\Lambda/8\\pi$ as the constant pressure due to a cosmological fluid. However, the notions of pressure and thermodynamic volume in black hole thermodynamics are very different from their counterparts in classical thermodynamics. From this point of view, there is \\textit{a priori} no compelling reason to not extend this notion of pressure and associate a partial pressure with each external\" density $8\\pi T_{t}{}^{t}$. In this work, we associate a partial pressure with a variable mass parameter as well as with each $tt$ component of the effective stress-energy tensor $T_{\\text{eff}\\,\\mu}{}^{\\nu}$ but not with the linear component of the electromagnetic field. Using the field equations $G_{\\mu}{}^{\\nu}=8\\pi T_{\\text{eff}\\,\\mu}{}^{\\nu}$, we derive universal expressions for the enthalpy, internal energy, free energies, thermodynamic volume, equation of state, law of corresponding states, criticality, and critical exponents of static (nonrotating) charged black holes, with possibly a variable mass parameter, whether they are solutions to the Einstein field equations or not. We extend the derivation to the case where the black hole is immersed in the field of a quintessence force and to the multiforce case. Many applications and extensions are considered, including applications to regular black holes derived in previous and present work. No inconsistency has been noticed in their thermodynamics. ",

    "abstract": "  It is widely accepted that the fundamental geometrical law of nature should follow from an action principle. The particular subset of transformations of a system's dynamical variables that maintain the form of the action principle comprises the group of canonical transformations. In the context of canonical field theory, the adjective \"extended\" signifies that not only the fields but also the space-time geometry is subject to transformation. Thus, in order to be physical, the transition to another, possibly noninertial frame of reference must necessarily constitute an extended canonical transformation that defines the general mapping of the connection coefficients, hence the quantities that determine the space-time curvature and torsion of the respective reference frame. The canonical transformation formalism defines simultaneously the transformation rules for the conjugates of the connection coefficients and for the Hamiltonian. As will be shown, this yields unambiguously a particular Hamiltonian that is form-invariant under the canonical transformation of the connection coefficients and thus satisfies the general principle of relativity. This Hamiltonian turns out to be a quadratic function of the curvature tensor. Its Legendre-transformed counterpart then establishes a unique Lagrangian description of the dynamics of space-time that is not postulated but derived from basic principles, namely the action principle and the general principle of relativity. Moreover, the resulting theory satisfies the principle of scale invariance and is renormalizable. ",

Specifically, equations for the ionization fractions of hydrogen and singly ionized helium during the recombination epoch are deduced analytically and then solved numerically. By considering several approximations we find that the presence of primordial helium and its interaction with Lyman series photons has a much stronger effect on the overall free electron density in YMG than it does in the standard, General Relativity (GR) based, model. Compared to the standard model recombination happens over a much larger range of temperatures, although there is still a very sharp temperature of last scattering around 2000 K. Since the ionization history of the universe is not directly observable we discuss how one may use it to predict the CMB power spectrum and thus test YMG.

By imposing spherical symmetry and a suitable choice for the contorsion degrees of freedom, the static geometry provides deviations on the predictions of the observational tests predicted by General Relativity -- namely on the advance of planetary perihelia and the bending of light rays -- which we infer. The analytical extension is built in two particular domains of the parameter space. In the first domain we obtain a solution exhibiting an event horizon analogous to that of the Schwarzschild geometry. For the second domain, we show that the metric furnishes an exterior event horizon, and two interior horizons which enclose the singularity. For both branches we examine the effects of torsion corrections on the Hawking radiation. In this scenario the model extends Bekenstein's black hole geometrical thermodynamics, with an extra work term connected to a torsion parameter. ",

In this paper, we first prove a theorem derived from the first law of black hole thermodynamics and a mathematical lemma related to the Vandermonde determinant. With these arguments, we develop some general criterion for the mass independence of the entropy product as well as the entropy sum. In particular, if a $d$-dimensional spacetime is spherically symmetric and its radial metric function $f(r)$ is a Laurent series in $r$ with the lowest power $-m$ and the highest power $n$, we find the criteria is extremely simple: The entropy product is mass independent if and only if $m\\geq d-2$ and $n\\geq4-d$. The entropy sum is mass independent if and only if $m\\geq d-2$ and $n\\geq 2$. Compared to previous works, our method does not require an exact expression of the metric.   Our arguments turn out to be useful even for rotating black holes. By applying our theorem and lemma to a Myers-Perry black hole with spacetime dimension $d$, we show that the entropy product/sum is mass independent for all $d>4$, while it is mass dependent only for $d=4$, i.e., the Kerr solution.

As Fast Fourier Transform algorithms have become considerably faster and in order to circumvent possible problems with the SPA, we test GR with corrected time domain waveforms instead of SPA waveforms. Since a considerable amount of work has been done already in the field using SPA waveforms, we establish a connection between leading-order-corrected waveforms in time and frequency domain, concentrating on phase-only corrected terms. In a Markov Chain Monte Carlo study, whose results are preliminary and will only be available later, we will assess the ability of the eLISA detector to measure deviations from GR for signals coming from supermassive black hole inspirals using these corrected waveforms.

In this picture, it is shown that for the non-minimal coupling case, the cosmological solutions indicate both an early-time inflation and late-time acceleration for the universe. ",

Alternatively, the BRST charge can be derived making use of the Noether theorem and global BRST invariance of the effective action. In the case of Yang - Mills fields the both methods lead to the same expression for the BRST charge, but it is not valid in the case of General Relativity. It is illustrated by examples of an isotropic cosmological model as well as by spherically-symmetric gravitational model which imitates the full theory of gravity much better. The consideration is based on Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity in extended phase space. At the quantum level the structure of the BRST charge is of great importance since BRST invariant quantum states are believed to be physical states. Thus, the definition of the BRST charge at the classical level is inseparably related to our attempts to find a true way to quantize Gravity. ",

We propose a fully constrained scheme and use spherical polar coordinates. A general problem for this choice is the occurrence of coordinate singularities on the axis of symmetry and at the origin. Spherical harmonics are manifestly regular on the axis and hence take care of that issue automatically. In addition a spectral approach has computational advantages when the equations are implemented. Therefore we spectrally decompose all the variables in the appropriate harmonics. A central point in the formulation is the gauge choice. One of our results is that the commonly used maximal-isothermal gauge turns out to be incompatible with tensor harmonic expansions, and we introduce a new gauge that is better suited. We also address the regularisation of the coordinate singularity at the origin. ",

Our analysis shows that in fact this is not the case: Quantum gravitational states with support in spacetime configurations that exclusively describe either the region between horizons or outside them are not consistent in the sense that there exist unitary operators describing a natural notion of evolution that connect them.

    "abstract": "  To solve the path integral for quantum gravity, one needs to regularise the space-times that are summed over. This regularisation usually is a discretisation, which makes it necessary to give up some paradigms or symmetries of continuum physics.   Causal dynamical triangulations regularises the path integral through a simplicial discretisation that introduces a preferred time foliation.   The first part of this thesis presents three articles on causal dynamical triangulations. The first article shows how to obtain a multicritical 2d model by coupling the theory to hard dimers. The second explores the connection to Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity that is suggested by the time foliation and establishes that in 2d the theories are equivalent. The last article does not directly concern causal dynamical triangulations but Euclidian dynamical triangulations with an additional measure term, which are examined to understand whether they contain an extended phase without the need for a preferred time foliation.   Causal set theory uses an explicitly Lorentz invariant discretisation, which introduces non-local effects.   The second part of this thesis presents two articles in causal set theory. The first explicitly calculates closed form expressions for the d'Alembertian operator in any dimension, which can be implemented in computer simulations. The second develops a ruler to examine the manifoldlikeness of small regions in a causal set, and can be used to recover locality. ",

Generically the matter content gravitates in two different ways: On the one hand, the energy-momentum induces spacetime curvature; on the other hand, the presence of spin acts as a source for the spacetime torsion, which does not propagate. In this setup we consider the most general stationary spherically symmetric ansatz and we find an analytic black hole solution that supports a nontrivial spinor configuration. The spinor field affects the geometry by inducing spacetime torsion, though, remarkably, it does not alter the black hole metric, which retains its Schwarzschild form. We find solutions both in asymptotically flat and asymptotically (Anti) de Sitter spaces. Additionally, we consider how the solution gets deformed when the so-called Holst term is included in the gravity action. We discuss possible observational effects due to the coupling of fermions in the nonvanishing torsion background. Additionally we include a Maxwell field into the problem and find that it forces the spinor field to be zero. Finally, nonminimal couplings of the spinor with spacetime curvature are considered, obtaining any effect on the spherically symmetric solutions. ",

    "abstract": "  The elegant predictions of loop quantum gravity are obscured by the free Immirizi parameter. Dreyer (2003), considering the asymptotic quasinormal modes spectrum of a black hole, proposed that the Immirizi parameter may be fixed by letting the j=1 transitions of spin networks as the dominant processes contributing to the black hole area, as opposed to the expected j=1/2 transitions. This suggested that the gauge group of the theory might be SO(3) rather than SU(2). Corichi (2003), maintaining SU(2) as the underlying gauge group, and invoking the principle of local fermion-number conservation, reported the same value of the Immirizi parameter for j=1 processes as obtained by Dreyer. In this note, preserving the SU(2) structure of the theory, and considering j=1 transitions as the dominant processes, we point out that the value of the Immirizi parameter is in fact twice the value reported by these authors. We arrive at this result by assuming the asymptotic quasinormal modes themselves as dynamical systems obeying SU(2) symmetry. ",

These distributions share the property that there is a lower bound at a finite negative value, but no upper bound. Thus arbitrarily large positive energy density fluctuations are possible. In two dimensions we are able to give an exact unique analytic form for the distribution. However, in four dimensions, we are not able to give closed form expressions for the probability distribution, but rather use calculations of a finite number of moments to estimate the lower bound, and the asymptotic form of the tail of the distribution. The first 65 moments are used for these purposes. All of our four-dimensional results are subject to the caveat that these distributions are not uniquely determined by the moments. One can apply the asymptotic form of the electromagnetic energy density distribution to estimate the nucleation rates of black holes and of Boltzmann brains. ",

Instead, the boson stars with nontrivial topology approach a singular configuration in the limit of vanishing frequency. Depending on the value of the coupling constant, the wormhole geometry changes from a single throat configuration to a double throat configuration, featuring a belly inbetween the two throats. Depending on the mass of the boson field and its self-interaction, the mass and the size of these objects cover many orders of magnitude, making them amenable to various astrophysical observations. A stability analysis reveals, that the unstable mode of the Ellis wormhole is retained in the presence of the bosonic matter.

    "abstract": "  Many of the technical complications associated with the general theory of relativity ultimately stem from the nonlinearity of Einstein's equation. It is shown here that an appropriate choice of dynamical variables may be used to eliminate all such nonlinearities beyond a particular order: Both Landau-Lifshitz and tetrad formulations of Einstein's equation are obtained which involve only finite products of the unknowns and their derivatives. Considerable additional simplifications arise in physically-interesting cases where metrics becomes approximately Kerr or, e.g., plane waves, suggesting that the variables described here can be used to efficiently reformulate perturbation theory in a variety of contexts. In all cases, these variables are shown to have simple geometrical interpretations which directly relate the local causal structure associated with the metric of interest to the causal structure associated with a prescribed background. A new method to search for exact solutions is outlined as well. ",

    "abstract": "  Fermi normal coordinates provide a standardized way to describe the effects of gravitation from the point of view of an inertial observer. These coordinates have always been introduced via perturbation expansions and were usually limited to distances much less than the characteristic length scale set by the curvature of spacetime. For a plane gravitational wave this scale is given by its wavelength which defines the domain of validity for these coordinates known as the long-wavelength regime. The symmetry of this spacetime, however, allows us to extend Fermi normal coordinates far beyond the long-wavelength regime. Here we present an explicit construction for this long-range Fermi normal coordinate system based on the unique solution of the boundary-value problem for spacelike geodesics. The resulting formulae amount to summation of the infinite series for Fermi normal coordinates previously obtained with perturbation expansions. We also consider two closely related normal coordinate systems: optical coordinates which are built from null geodesics and wave-synchronous coordinates which are built from spacelike geodesics locked in phase with the propagating gravitational wave. The wave-synchronous coordinates yield the exact solution of Peres and Ehlers-Kundt which is globally defined. In this case, the limitation of the long-wavelength regime is completely overcome, and the system of wave-synchronous coordinates becomes valid for arbitrarily large distances. Comparison of the different coordinate systems is done by considering the motion of an inertial test mass in the field of a plane gravitational wave. ",

    "abstract": "  Einstein spacetimes (that is vacuum spacetimes possibly with a non-zero cosmological constant {\\Lambda}) with constant non-zero Weyl eigenvalus are considered. For type Petrov II & D this assumption allows one to prove that the non-repeated eigenvalue necessarily has the value 2{\\Lambda}/3 and it turns out that the only possible spacetimes are some Kundt-waves considered by Lewandowski which are type II and a Robinson-Bertotti solution of type D. For Petrov type I the only solution turns out to be a homogeneous pure vacuum solution found long ago by Petrov using group theoretic methods. These results can be summarised by the statement that the only vacuum spacetimes with constant Weyl eigenvalues are either homogeneous or are Kundt space- times. This result is similar to that of Coley et al. who proved their result for general spacetimes under the assumption that all scalar invariants constructed from the curvature tensor and all its derivatives were constant. Some preliminary results are also presented for Petrov Type I vacua in which either only one of the Weyl eigenvalues is constant or in which the ratios of the Weyl eigenvalues are constants. In particular in each case there is a simple algebraic relation between the Newman-Penrose Weyl tensor components $\\Psi_2$ & $\\Psi_0 (=\\Psi_4)$ and the 'cross-ratio' of the optical scalars {\\kappa}{\\nu}-{\\sigma}{\\lambda} of the associated principal null tetrad of the Weyl tensor.

We show that at late time the cosmic coincidence problem can be alleviated. Also we show that for non-interacting case, HDE can give a unified dark matter-dark energy profile in BD cosmology, except that it cannot solve the coincidence problem in the future. By studying the equation of state parameter, we see that the phantom divide may be crossed. Using the latest observational data, we calculate the best values of the parameters for interacting HDE in BD framework. Computing the deceleration parameter implies that the transition from deceleration to the acceleration phase occurred for redshift $z\\geq 0.5$. Finally, we investigate the sound stability of the model, and find that HDE with GO cutoff in the framework of BD cosmology can lead to a stable DE-dominated universe favored by observations, provided we take $\\beta=0.44$ and $b^2<0.35$.

However, it is susceptible to false alarms from instrumental artefacts, for example quasi-monochromatic disturbances ('lines'), which resemble a CW signal more than Gaussian noise. In a recent paper [Keitel et al 2014, PRD 89 064023], a Bayesian model selection approach was used to derive line-robust detection statistics for CW signals, generalising both the F-statistic and the F-statistic consistency veto technique and yielding improved performance in line-affected data. Here we investigate a generalisation of the assumptions made in that paper: if a CW analysis uses data from two or more detectors with very different sensitivities, the line-robust statistics could be less effective. We investigate the boundaries within which they are still safe to use, in comparison with the F-statistic. Tests using synthetic draws show that the optimally-tuned version of the original line-robust statistic remains safe in most cases of practical interest. We also explore a simple idea on further improving the detection power and safety of these statistics, which we however find to be of limited practical use. ",

Analytic results for the slope of this energy curve in the high-energy domain are derived, and the energy curve is plotted exactly for small number of vertices $N$.

Field equations are obtained by restructuring the Proca equations that are commensurate with the low order retardation solutions. The solutions are not in the Lorentz gauge and they are not solutions to the unmodified Proca equations. The high order terms are not solutions to the equations.

The most interesting among them both in terms of elegance of the setup and of the richness of the emerging phenomenology is the Randall-Sundrum II model where one infinite extra spacelike dimension is considered with an AdS topology, characterized by the warping effect caused by the presence of a negative cosmological constant in the bulk. A major drawback of this model is that despite numerous efforts no line element has ever been found that could describe a stable, regular, realistic black hole. Finding a smoothly behaved such solution supported by the presence of some more or less conventional fields either in the bulk and/or on the brane is the core of the black hole challenge. After a comprehensive presentation of the details of the model and the analysis of the significance and the utility of getting a specific analytic black hole solution, several (unsuccessful) analytic and numerical approaches to the problem developed over the years are presented with some discussion about their results.

We propose a particular example of a relational configuration space, the 2 instant relation (2IR), whose embeddible configurations describe particle worldlines in a background spacetime. We investigate the properties of these configurations. ",

In our model one does not need any specific matter field to drive inflation, but inflation stems from the microscopic, Planck scale structure of spacetime, thus being of quantum gravitational origin. At a certain temperature spacetime performs a phase transition, where the cosmological constant drops from a huge, Planck scale value, which is about $10^{87}s^{-2}$ to its present, pretty small value $10^{-35}s^{-2}$. When the cosmological constant is large, the universe goes through a period of very rapid expansion which, however, comes to an abrupt end after the phase transition has been completed. Assuming that the cosmological constant depends on the age of the universe in an appropriate manner during the phase transition one may recover the predictions of the conventional inflationary scenario.

The interaction with the background fluid is modeled by introducing a Poynting-Robertson-like friction force in the equations of motion, leading to measurable (at least in principle) deviations of the particle trajectories from geodesic motion. The effect on the peculiar velocities of the particles is investigated for various equations of state of the background fluid and different standard cosmological models. The friction force is found to have major effects on particle motion in closed FRW universes, where it turns the time-asymptotic value (approaching the recollapse) of the peculiar particle velocity from ultra-relativistic (close to light speed) to a co-moving one, i.e., zero peculiar speed. On the other hand, for open or flat universes the effect of the friction is not so significant, because the time-asymptotic peculiar particle speed is largely non-relativistic also in the geodesic case.

To do this, we first introduce the polymeric representation of the quantum operators. We then extend the corresponding process to reach a transformation which maps any classical variable to its polymeric counterpart. It is shown that such a formalism has also an analogue in terms of the symplectic structure, i.e., instead of applying polymerization to the classical Hamiltonian to arrive its polymeric form, one can use a new set of variables in terms of which Hamiltonian retains its form but now the corresponding symplectic structure gets a new deformed functional form. We show that these two methods are equivalent and by applying of them to the scalar field FRW cosmology see that the resulting scale factor exhibits a bouncing behavior from a contraction phase to an expanding era. Since the replacing of the big bang singularity by a bouncing behavior is one of the most important predictions of the quantum cosmological theories, we may claim that our polymerized classical model brings with itself some signals from quantum theory.

At a quantum level, this view of \"change as relative variation\" leads to a \"fundamentally timeless\" formalism for quantum gravity. Here, we will show how one may avoid this acute `problem of time'. Under our view, duration is still regarded as relative, but temporal succession is taken to be absolute. Following our approach, which is presented in more formal terms in arXiv:1303.7139, it is possible to conceive of a genuinely dynamical theory of quantum gravity within which time, in a substantive sense, remains.

    "abstract": "  We investigate the late-time asymptotics of future expanding, polarized vacuum Einstein spacetimes with T2-symmetry on T3, which, by definition, admit two spacelike Killing fields. Our main result is the existence of a stable asymptotic regime within this class, that is, we provide here a full description of the late-time asymptotics of the solutions to the Einstein equations when the initial data set is close to the asymptotic regime. Our proof is based on several energy functionals with lower order corrections (as is standard for such problems) and the derivation of a simplified model which we exhibit here. Roughly speaking, the Einstein equations in the symmetry class under consideration consists of a system of wave equations coupled to constraint equations plus a system of ordinary differential equations. The unknowns involved in the system of ordinary equations are blowing up in the future timelike directions. One of our main contributions is the derivation of novel effective equations for suitably renormalized unknowns. Interestingly, this renormalization is not performed with respect to a fixed background, but does involve the energy of the coupled system of wave equations. In addition, we construct an open set of initial data which are arbitrarily close to the expected asymptotic behavior. We emphasize that, in comparison, the class of Gowdy spacetimes exhibits a very different dynamical behavior to the one we uncover in the present work for general polarized T2-symmetric spacetimes. Furthermore, all the conclusions of this paper are valid within the framework of weakly T2-symmetric spacetimes previously introduced by the authors. ",

    "abstract": "  Accretion of fields by black holes is a subject of great interest in physics. It is known that accretion plays a fundamental role in active galactic nuclei and in the evolution of black holes. Accretion of fundamental fields is often related to the study of absorption cross section. Basically all black holes for which absorption of fields has been studied so far present singularities. However, even within general relativity, it is possible to construct regular black holes: objects with event horizons but without singularities. Many physically motivated regular black hole solutions have been proposed in the past years, demanding the understanding of their absorption properties. We study the absorption of planar massless scalar waves by Bardeen regular black holes. We compare the absorption cross section of Bardeen and Reissner--Nordstr\\\"om black holes, showing that the former always have a bigger absorption cross section for fixed values of the field frequency and of the normalized black hole charge. We also show that it is possible for a Bardeen black hole to have the same high-frequency absorption cross section of a Reissner--Nordstr\\\"om black hole. Our results suggest that, in mid-to-high-frequency regimes, regular black holes can have compatible properties with black holes with singularities, as far as absorption is concerned. ",

We demonstrate that the considered Universe has a nonsingular quantum behavior, associated to a primordial bounce, whose ground state has a high occupation number. Furthermore, in such a vacuum state, the super-Hamiltonian eigenvalue is negative, corresponding to a positive emerging dust energy density. The regularization of the model is performed via a polymer quantum approach to the Universe scale factor and the proper classical limit is then recovered, in agreement with a preinflationary state of the Universe. Since the dust energy density is redshifted by the Universe deSitter phase and the cosmological constant does not enter the ground state eigenvalue, we get a late-time cosmology, compatible with the present observations, endowed with a turning point in the far future.

Soon, gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Advanced LIGO and eLISA will be able to probe this regime by measuring GWs from inspiraling and merging compact binaries. One particularly interesting alternative to GR is scalar-tensor gravity. We present progress in the calculation of second post-Newtonian (2PN) gravitational waveforms for inspiraling compact binaries in a general class of scalar-tensor theories. The waveforms are constructed using a standard GR method known as \"direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations,\" appropriately adapted to the scalar-tensor case. We find that differences from general relativity can be characterized by a reasonably small number of parameters. Among the differences are new hereditary terms which depend on the past history of the source. In one special case, binary black hole systems, we find that the waveform is indistinguishable from that of general relativity. In another, mixed black hole-neutron star systems, all differences from GR can be characterized by only a single parameter. ",

The perturbations are restricted to axial symmetry but break the cylindrical symmetry of the background metric. We analyze the gauge issues that arise in setting up the appropriate form of the perturbed metric and show that it is possible to restrict to diagonal terms, but that this does not fix the gauge completely. We derive the perturbation equations and show that they can be solved by solving a third order ordinary differential equation for an appropriately chosen function of the perturbed metric coefficients. The set of solutions of this equation contains gauge trivial parts, and we show how to extract the gauge non trivial components. We introduce appropriate boundary conditions on the solutions and show that these lead to a boundary value problem that determines the allowed functional forms of the perturbation modes. The associated eigenvalues determine a sort of \"dispersion relation\" for the frequencies and corresponding \"wave vector\" components. The central result of this analysis is that the spectrum of allowed frequencies contains one unstable (imaginary frequency) mode for every possible choice of the background metric. The completeness of the mode expansion in relation to the initial value problem and to the gauge problem is discussed in detail, and we show that the perturbations contain an unstable component for generic initial data, and, therefore, that the Levi-Civita space times are gravitationally unstable. We also include, for completeness, a set of approximate eigenvalues, and examples of the functional form of the solutions. ",

We also calculate the potential barrier of a scalar field to reach r $\\rightarrow\\infty$ in the ambient space. The results show that the potential barrier is finite, hence the static observer at r $\\rightarrow\\infty$ can indeed detect the radiation caused by the Unruh effect from the embedding view. However the potential barriers calculated in both the Riemann background and the Minkowski background are not coincident, therefore the GEMS approach is not complete and the Hawking effect can be distinguished from the Unruh effect of the GEMS in principle.

Under specific conditions, the expansion scalar is shown to exhibit a finite jump (from negative to positive value) before focusing eventually occurs. This nonmonotonic behavior of the expansion, observed in our numerical work, is successfully explained through an analysis of the equation for the expansion.

This model, first introduced by Rastall, cannot be derived from an action principle. We formulate phenomenological equations of motion under the guiding principle of minimal possible deformation of the standard equations. We construct string solutions that asymptote to a flat space-time with a deficit angle by solving the set of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations numerically. Decreasing the Rastall parameter from its Einstein gravity value we find that the deficit angle of the space-time increases and becomes equal to $2\\pi$ at some critical value of this parameter that depends on the remaining couplings in the model. For smaller values the resulting solutions are supermassive string solutions possessing a singularity at a finite distance from the string core. Assuming the Higgs boson mass to be on the order of the gauge boson mass we find that also in Rastall gravity this happens only when the symmetry breaking scale is on the order of the Planck mass. We also observe that for specific values of the parameters in the model the energy per unit length becomes proportional to the winding number, i.e. the degree of the map $S^1 \\rightarrow S^1$. Unlike in the BPS limit in Einstein gravity, this is, however, not connect to an underlying mathematical structure, but rather constitutes a would-be-BPS bound. ",

This map is not convergent due to a lack of the Peter-Weyl theorem for unitary representations of the non-compact groups, particularly Lorentz group. In this paper we provide an alternative improved convergent map $\\tilde{Y}$. The image of a new map $\\tilde{Y}$ contains the weighted infinite sum of $SL(2,C)$ matrix coefficients. The sum is convergent and its limit is the square integrable functions of $SL(2,C)$ with the measure $L^2(g, e^{-|Y|^2/\\hbar}\\eta(g) du \\,dY)$ according to the recently proved Holomorphic Peter-Weyl theorem \\cite{Huebschmann}, which is applicable to the rational representations of the non-unitary groups, particularly non-unitary finite Lorenz representations. Since in LQG the unitary evolution is not mandatory as it does not follow from the Wheeler-DeWitt dynamics equation, the choice of the non-unitary representation is valid. As it was stated in the original LQG formulation $\\cite{RovelliBook}$ in the section 10.1.3 \"there is no sense in which conventional unitarity is necessary in the theory\". We also discuss in this paper the consequence of the choice of the unitary principal series instead of the general principal series (sometimes called non-unitary) in EPRL model. The general principal series contains the unitary principal series as a sub-representation and becomes unitary when its parameter $\\nu$ is real rather than complex.

This means that, when gravitational radiation is present, asymptotically covariantly constant vector fields do not exist. On the other hand, according to the Bondi-Sachs construction, a weaker class of asymptotically constant vectors does exist. Reconciling these concepts leads to a measure of the scattering of matter by gravitational waves, that is, bulk exchanges of energy-momentum between the waves and matter. Because these bulk effects are potentially larger than the tidal ones which have usually been studied, they may affect the waves' propagation more significantly, and the question of matter's transparency to gravitational radiation should be revisited. While in many cases there is reason to think the waves will be only slightly affected, some situations are identified in which the energy-momentum exchanges can be substantial enough that a closer investigation should be made. In particular, the work here suggests that gravitational waves produced when relativistic jets are formed might be substantially affected by passing through an inhomogeneous medium. ",

Observations in this band have amazing scientific potential. The mergers between massive black holes with mass in the range 10 thousand to 10 million solar masses, which are expected to occur following the mergers of their host galaxies, produce strong millihertz gravitational radiation. Observations of these systems will trace the hierarchical assembly of structure in the Universe in a mass range that is very difficult to probe electromagnetically. Stellar mass compact objects falling into such black holes in the centres of galaxies generate detectable gravitational radiation for several years prior to the final plunge and merger with the central black hole. Measurements of these systems offer an unprecedented opportunity to probe the predictions of general relativity in the strong-field and dynamical regime. Millihertz gravitational waves are also generated by millions of ultra-compact binaries in the Milky Way, providing a new way to probe galactic stellar populations. ESA has recognised this great scientific potential by selecting The Gravitational Universe as its theme for the L3 large satellite mission, scheduled for launch in ~2034.

We reproduce the quasinormal modes for the massless scalar field harmonics $\\ell = 0$, $1$ and $2$. For these same harmonics, in the linear approximation, we calculate the balance of energy between the black hole and the world tube. As an example of nonlinear harmonic generation, we show the distortion of a marginally trapped two-surface approximated as a q-boundary and based upon the harmonic $\\ell=2$. Additionally, we study the evolution of the $\\ell = 8$ harmonic in order to test the solver in a spacetime with a complex angular structure. Further applications and extensions are briefly discussed. ",

In particular, we introduce 'longest/shortest path plots' as a way to visually detect the extent to which a DAG matches the reversed triangular inequality of special relativity (and the twin paradox), and we use it for assessing causets both of stochastic and of deterministic, algorithmic origin. We identify a very simple deterministic algorithm that behaves optimally in this respect. ",

From the reported orbital parameters of this triple system, we give an uplimited estimation of the Nordtvedt parameter $\\eta_\\text{N} < 10^{-4}$ based on the orbital polarization calculation. This result is slightly better than the existed ones.

The Killing and homothetic vector analysis in GHP formalism is then generalised to this case were there is only one null direction defined geometrically. We determine the existing Killing vectors for the different subclasses that arise in the classification and compare these results to those obtained in the symmetry analysis performed by Siklos for a larger class of metrics with Ricci tensor representing a pure radiation field and a negative cosmological constant.

A TOBA is a novel type of an antenna for low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) which consists of two bar-shaped orthogonal test masses. Previously only the rotation of the bars on the horizontal plane had been considered as output signals. In this paper, we introduce a new antenna configuration for a TOBA to incorporate two additional outputs by measuring the rotation of the bars on the vertical planes. Such a triple-output TOBA can be regarded as a network of three coincident but misaligned interferometric detectors. We investigate its event detection rate and its parameter accuracies using Fisher analysis. We find that since the triple-output TOBA can discriminate two polarization modes of a short-duration GW signal even with a single antenna thanks to having three independent outputs, it improves the detection rate and the accuracies of waveform parameters drastically.

The event horizon kinks when it intersects a shockwave. We calculate the timelike separation between the crossable boundary (marginally trapped tubes plus connecting shockwaves) and event horizon. As measured along the crossable boundary this function can have discontinuities not only in its derivative but also in the function itself. These features are closely related to the geometry of the crossable boundary.

In other words, this is the information contained within a given finite region of space that includes a finite amount of energy. Similarly, this can be thought as the maximum amount of information required to perfectly describe a given physical system down to its quantum level. If the energy and the region of space are finite then the number of information N required in describing the physical system is also finite. In this short letter two information number bounds are derived and compared for two types of universe. First, a universe without a cosmological constant lamda and second a universe with a cosmological constant lamda are investigated. This is achieved with the derivation of two different relations that connect the Hubble constant and cosmological constants to the number of information N. We find that the number of information N involved in a the two universes are identical or   N1=N2, and that the total mass of the universe scales as the square root of the information number N, containing an information number N of the order of 10E+122. Finally, we expressed Calogero quantization action as a function of the number of information N. We also have found that in self gravitating systems the number of information N in nats is the ratio of the total kinetic to total thermal energy of the system. ",

We are interested in exact solutions for stress-energy tensor components depending on different shape and redshift functions. Several solutions of gravitational equations for different $f(R)$ models are examined. Found solutions imply no need for exotic material, while this need is implied in the standard general theory of relativity. Simple expression for WEC violation near the throat is derived and analysed. High curvature regime is also discussed, as well as the question of the highest possible values of Ricci scalar for which WEC is not violated near the throat, and corresponding functions are calculated for the several models. The approach here differs from the one that has been common since no additional assumptions to simplify the equations are made, and functions in $f(R)$ models are not taken to be arbitrary functions, but rather a feature of the theory that has to be evaluated on the basis of consistency with observations for the Solar System and cosmological evolution.

The solution is valid through first order in the mass-difference parameter. A canonical point transformation removes the leading order terms of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian which induce a wiggling precession of the orbital angular momentum around the conserved total angular momentum, a precession which disappears in the case of equal masses or one single spin. Action-angle variables are applied which make a canonical perturbation theory easily treatable. ",

This is due to a driving axion potential $V(\\left|\\varphi\\right|)$, whose origins reside within the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The effect of a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$, introduced to represent the vacuum energy of space, is also investigated. Preliminary results suggest that $\\Lambda$ is analogous to a spring-constant, and thus determining the elasticity of space. Additionally, a cosmological scale-factor $a(t,r)$, notably with an added spatial dependence, is also considered. We propose that due to this inhomogeneous scale-factor, the energy-density is characteristic of temperature fluctuations observed within the cosmic microwave background. Such fluctuations could ultimately lead to a universe composed of filaments and voids; vast expanses of space, separated by regions of localised matter/energy-density. Finally, we provide a means of screening both the cosmological constant and curvature of the universe, to effective values that are more consistent with experimental observation. ",

The e-folding number for slow-rolling inflation depends on the values of the parameter $\\alpha$ of the exponential potential and the initial conditions. To get enough e-folding number, $\\alpha$ should be small. Based on the slow-rolling inflation happens immediately when the super inflation ends, and the scale factor is continuously growing during the whole inflation stage, we consider an e-folding number provided by the whole inflationary stage, and we find that it is easier to get enough e-folding number when the scale factor increases during all the inflation phase.

The suggested technique is based on the oscillation period of a test mass oscillating through a hole bored in a solid sphere in free space, or, equivalently, in orbit. The period of oscillation depends only on the density of the solid sphere, providing a method with systematic errors different from terrestrial approaches to the determination of G.

This note is concerned with the theoretical basis for the predictions. The predictions depend on three elements of gravity theory, firstly that macroscopic gravity is described by a metric theory such as general relativity, secondly that the Lense-Thirring metric provides an approximate description of the gravitational field of the spinning earth, and thirdly that the spin axis of a gyroscope is parallel displaced in spacetime, which gives its equation of motion. We look at each of these three elements to show how each is solidly based on previous experiments and well-tested theory. The agreement of GP-B with theory strengthens our belief that all three elements are correct and increases our confidence in applying GR to astrophysical phenomena. Conversely, if GP-B had not verified the predictions a major theoretical quandary would have occurred. ",

    "abstract": "  In this dissertation we study two well known gravitational scenarios in which singularities may appear; the final state of gravitational collapse and the late time evolution of the universe. In the first scenario, we study a spherically symmetric space-time whose matter content includes a tachyon scalar field and a barotropic fluid. By employing a dynamical system analysis, we find classical solutions corresponding to a naked singularity or a black hole formation. We then investigate, in a semiclassical manner, loop quantum gravity induced effects on the fate of the classical singularities. By employing an inverse triad correction, we identify a subset which corresponds to an outward flux of energy, thus avoiding either a naked singularity or a black hole formation. Within a holonomy correction, we obtain the semiclassical counterpart of our (classical) general relativistic collapse in which, classical singularity is resolved and replaced by a bounce. In addition, we find a threshold scale for non-singular black hole formation. In the second scenario, we employ several models of dark energy to investigate the status of the late time cosmological singularities. In the first one we consider a DGP brane-world model with a GB term being provided for the bulk action; a phantom matter is present on the brane as dark energy component. It is shown that a combination of IR and UV modifications to general relativity replaces a big rip by a sudden singularity at late times. The second model we cosnider is the generalized running vacuum energy (GRVE) model. The Friedmann equation of the GRVE model looks much similar to the one of a holographic Ricci dark energy (HRDE) model. Despite the analogy between these two models, it turns out that one of them, a GRVE, is singularity-free in the future while the other, the HRDE, is not, which can hit, for example, a big rip singularity.

The Kerr geometry is the known exact solution to Einstein's equations for a static, eternal black hole within the framework of general relativity, and hence is of great importance in relativistic astrophysics. An understanding of the orbital dynamics of test bodies and light rays in the Kerr spacetime is therefore fundamental to the physics of a black hole. In this work, the scattering and capturing properties of unbound, \"hyperbolic\" orbits in the spacetime are studied. In particular, the differential scattering cross section and capture cross section are derived over the parameter space of energies, impact parameters and black hole spin orientation and magnitude. The problem is then generalized to the motion of two massive objects on a hyperbolic encounter, and the added effects of gravitational radiation and finite mass ratio studied within the post-Newtonian formalism.

The energy conditions, geometrical and physical properties of the solutions are studied.

    "abstract": "  An alternative inflationary model is proposed predicated upon a consideration of the form of the uncertainty principle in a curved background spacetime. An argument is presented suggesting a possible curvature dependence in the correct commutator relations for a quantum field in a classical background which cannot be deduced by simply extrapolation from the flat spacetime theory. To assess the possible consequences of this dependence, we apply the idea to a scalar field in a closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background, using a simple model for the curvature dependence (along the way, a previous result obtained by Bunch (1980) for the adiabatically expanded wave function is corrected). The result is a time-dependent cosmological constant, producing a vast amount of inflation that is independent of the mass of the matter field or its effective potential. Furthermore, it is seen that the field modes are initially zero for all wavelengths and come into being as the universe evolves. In this sense, the universe creates its contents out of its own expansion. At the end of the process, the matter field is far from equilibrium and essentially reproduces the initial conditions for the New Inflationary Model. ",

    "abstract": "  Using an approximate solution to the $N$-body problem in general relativity, and the \\emph{principle of local isotropy at any point}, we construct a cosmological model, with zero curvature, for a universe composed uniquely by collision-less gravitating point-particles. The result is not, as currently thought, a null pressure Friedman model, but one that reproduces quite well the dark phenomena.   We assume that there exist three consecutive ages with this property, formed by free atoms, stars and galaxies, respectively. Certainly, we are using a highly idealized view of the very complicated process going from uncoupled atoms to galaxies, but it allows us to obtain that the energy density at each epoch is of the form $ \\rho(a)=\\frac{3H_0^2}{8\\pi G}\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_{ba}(1+\\alpha)}{a^3}+ f(a)\\right) $, where $\\alpha$ is a constant, that we identify with the dark matter, and $f(a)$ a function of the scale factor, which is zero at galaxy formation and \\emph{practically constant at the present epoch}, constant that we identify with the cosmological constant.   The parameters of our model are the baryonic density $ \\Omega_{ba}$ and the redshifts $ z\"_i, z'_i, z_i $, corresponding to the effective decoupling of atoms and radiation, the formation of stars and galaxies respectively. The model sets a relation between the galaxy formation epoch and the amount of dark matter and dark energy, e.g., galaxy formation at $z_i \\approx 11$ produces $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.683$; and the function $f(a)$ predicts the begining of the acceleration recently at redshift $z\\approx 0.6 $, just as the $\\Lambda CDM$ model. So, the dark phenomena could be related to a revision of the dynamical description of a gas of collision-less gravitating particles. ",

    "abstract": "  In this paper we present a data analysis approach applicable to the potential saddle-point fly-by mission extension of LISA Pathfinder (LPF). At the peak of its sensitivity, LPF will sample the gravitational field in our Solar System with a precision of several $\\text{fm/s}^2/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ at frequencies around $1\\,\\text{mHz}$. Such an accurate accelerometer will allow us to test alternative theories of gravity that predict deviations from Newtonian dynamics in the non-relativistic limit. As an example, we consider the case of the Tensor-Vector-Scalar theory of gravity and calculate, within the non-relativistic limit of this theory, the signals that anomalous tidal stresses generate in LPF. We study the parameter space of these signals and divide it into two subgroups, one related to the mission parameters and the other to the theory parameters that are determined by the gravity model. We investigate how the mission parameters affect the signal detectability concluding that these parameters can be determined with the sufficient precision from the navigation of the spacecraft and fixed during our analysis. Further, we apply Bayesian parameter estimation and determine the accuracy to which the gravity theory parameters may be inferred. We evaluate the portion of parameter space that may be eliminated in case of no signal detection and estimate the detectability of signals as a function of parameter space location. We also perform a first investigation of non-Gaussian \"noise-glitches\" that may occur in the data. The analysis we develop is universal and may be applied to anomalous tidal stress induced signals predicted by any theory of gravity. ",

    "abstract": "  In this work a study about the energy-momentum of a new four-dimensional spherically symmetric, static and charged, regular black hole solution developed in the context of general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics is presented. Asymptotically, this new black hole solution behaves as the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution only for the particular value {\\mu}=4, where {\\mu} is a positive integer parameter appearing in the mass function of the solution. The calculations are performed by use of the Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Weinberg and M{\\o}ller energy-momentum complexes. In all the aforesaid prescriptions, the expressions for the energy of the gravitating system considered depend on the mass M of the black hole, its charge q, a positive integer {\\alpha} and the radial coordinate r. In all these pseudotensorial prescriptions the momenta are found to vanish, while the Landau-Lifshitz and Weinberg prescriptions give the same result for the energy distribution. In addition, the limiting behavior of the energy for the cases r tends toward infinity, r=0 and q=0 is studied. The special case {\\mu}=4 and {\\alpha}=3 is also examined.

First we show that for a stable circular orbit (if it exists) in any of these spacetimes all the infinitesimally close to it timelike geodesics constructed with the aid of the general geodesic deviation vector have the same length between a pair of conjugate points. In Reissner--Nordstr\\\"{o}m black hole metric we explicitly find the Jacobi fields on the radial geodesics and show that they are locally (and globally) maximal curves between any pair of their points outside the outer horizon. If a radial and circular geodesics in R--N metric have common endpoints, the radial one is longer. If a static spherically symmetric spacetime is ultrastatic, its gravitational field exerts no force on a free particle which may stay at rest; the free particle in motion has a constant velocity (in this sense the motion is uniform) and its total energy always exceeds the rest energy, i.~e.~it has no gravitational energy. Previously the absence of the gravitational force has been known only for the global Barriola--Vilenkin monopole. In the spacetime of the monopole we explicitly find all timelike geodesics, the Jacobi fields on them and the condition under which a generic geodesic may have conjugate points. ",

Besides, the mechanism shows to be responsible for a transition from an accelerated to a decelerated regime, which certifies the importance, in cosmological terms, of its role. After symmetry breaking, the total pressure of the fields change its sign from negative to positive corresponding to the accelerated-decelerated transition.

    "abstract": "  The dynamics of extended bodies is a fundamental problem in any gravitational theory. In the case of General Relativity, this problem is under study since the theory was published. Several methods have been developed and different approaches are avalaible in the literature to interpret the relativistic contributions in the motion under gravity influence. The main goal in this thesis is to study a general method to face the equation of motion for extended bodies in General Relativity. We started with a proposal in the Newtonian theory, which consists in a multipolar expansion for the gravitational potentials as a function of the mass density moments and other physical variables as the stress tensor. The methodology give us the equation of motion for an isolated and self-gravitating system of extended bodies in Newtonian mechanics. A geometrical approach to get the equation of motion is also used for the Newtonian problems, it allows us to extend the methodology to General Relativity. In General Relativity, some new concepts are necessary: world tube, world line, generalized ideas of momentum, angular momentum, torque and center of mass are introduced in a general context. General expressions for the equation of motion in the case of extended bodies are written without any restriction. In order to gain some physical understanding, we compute the Papapetrous's equation of motion for a test extended body in a static and isotropic metric. Finally, we study a system of two extended bodies in the post-Newtonian approximation. We define the mass multipole moments and momentum from the gravitational potentials (metric functions) to the first post-Newtonian order. We follow the Landau-Liftshitz formalism to find out the equation of motion for the moments and applying the standard coordinate transformation for this theory, we write the traslational equation of motion.

In the cases of double positioning, the true location may be found using additional information (angles or times). The zone where the Jacobian, J, of the transformation from inertial to emission coordinates vanishes is also represented and interpreted. It is shown that the uncertainties in the satellite world lines produce positioning errors, which depend on the value of |J|. The smaller this quantity the greater the expected positioning errors. Among all the available 4-tuples of satellites, the most appropriate one -for a given location- should minimize positioning errors (large enough |J| values) avoiding bifurcation.

    "abstract": "  Global navigation satellite systems use appropriate satellite constellations to get the coordinates of an user -close to Earth- in an almost inertial reference system. We have simulated both GPS and GALILEO constellations. Uncertainties in the satellite world lines lead to dominant positioning errors. In this paper, a detailed analysis of these errors is developed inside a great region surrounding Earth. This analysis is performed in the framework of the so-called relativistic positioning systems. Our study is based on the Jacobian, J, of the transformation giving the emission coordinates in terms of the inertial ones. Around points of vanishing J, positioning errors are too large. We show that, for any 4-tuple of satellites, the points with J=0 are located at distances, D, from the Earth centre greater than about 2R/3, where R is the radius of the satellite orbits which are assumed to be circumferences. Our results strongly suggest that, for D-distances greater than 2R/3 and smaller than 100000 km, a rather good positioning may be achieved by using appropriate satellite 4-tuples without J=0 points located in the user vicinity. The way to find these 4-tuples is discussed for arbitrary users with D<100000 km and, then, preliminary considerations about satellite navigation at D<100000 km are presented. Future work on the subject of space navigation -based on appropriate simulations- is in progress. ",

The price we have to pay is that this procedure causes an \"explosion\" of values due to multiplicities. We also observe that this procedure is not reversible.

Both the Dark Matter scenario and Modified Gravity Theories (MGT) fails to explain the existence of such an acceleration scale. Motivated by the closeness of this acceleration scale and $c H_0\\approx 10^{-9} h$ $ m/s^2$, we analyse whether this coincidence might have a Cosmological origin for scalar-tensor and spinor-tensor theories, performing detailed calculations for perturbations that represent the local matter distribution on the top of the cosmological background. Then, we solve the field equations for these perturbations in a power series in the present value of the Hubble constant. As we shall see, for both theories the power expansion contains only even powers in the Hubble constant, a fact that renders the cosmological expansion irrelevant for the local dynamics. At last, we show what a difference a theory predicting linear terms in H makes in the local dynamics. ",

The CSs would generate not only usual continuous GW, but also impulsive GW that brings more concentrated energy and consists of different GW components broadly covering low-, intermediate- and high-frequency bands simultaneously. These features might underlie interesting electromagnetic(EM) response to these GWs generated by the CSs. In this paper, with novel results and effects, we firstly calculate the analytical solutions of perturbed EM fields caused by interaction between impulsive cylindrical GWs (would be one of possible forms emitted from CSs) and background celestial high magnetic fields or widespread cosmological background magnetic fields, by using rigorous Einstein - Rosen metric. Results show: perturbed EM fields are also in the impulsive form accordant to the GW pulse, and asymptotic behaviors of the perturbed EM fields are fully consistent with the asymptotic behaviors of the energy density, energy flux density and Riemann curvature tensor of corresponding impulsive cylindrical GWs. The analytical solutions naturally give rise to the accumulation effect which is proportional to the term of distance^1/2, and based on it, we for the first time predict potentially observable effects in region of the Earth caused by the EM response to GWs from the CSs.

    "abstract": "  In a previous paper, the author introduced a covariant causet ($c$-causet) approach to discrete quantum gravity. A $c$-causet is a finite partially ordered set that is invariant under labeling. The invariant labeling of a $c$-causet $x$ enables us to uniquely specify $x$ by a sequence $\\brac{s_j(x)}$, $j=0,1,2,\\ldots$, of positive integers called a shell sequence of $x$. A $c$-causet $x$ describes the microscopic structure of a possible universe at a particular time step. In general, $x$ represents one of many universes in a multiverse and $x$ grows by a single element at each time step. Since early stages of a universe were probably composed of elementary particles, we propose that elementary particles can be described by simple $c$-causets. Although we do not have a rigorous theory for such a description, we present our guess as to how it might appear. The shell sequence can be applied to find theoretical masses of particles and these seem to approximately agree with known masses. We point out that the causal order provides a unification of the strong and weak forces for elementary particles and also determines the geometry of $c$-causets which describes gravity. Moreover, it appears that some particles correspond to dark matter-energy. ",

    "abstract": "  The growing reality of gravitational wave astronomy is giving age-old problems a new lease of life; one such problem is that of the self-force. A charged or massive particle moving in a curved background space-time produces a field that affects its motion, pushing it off its expected geodesic. This self-field gives rise to a so-called self-force acting on the particle. In modelling this motion, the self-force approach uses a perturbative expansion in the mass ratio. One of the most interesting sources of gravitational waves are extreme mass ratio inspirals - systems perfectly suited to self-force modelling. One of the key problems within the self-force model is the divergence of the field at the particle. To resolve this, the field is split into a singular component and a smooth regular field. This regular-singular split, introduced by Detweiler and Whiting, is used in most modern self-force calculations. In this thesis, we derive high-order expansions of the Detweiler-Whiting singular field, and use these to push the boundaries on current precision limits of self-force calculations. Within the mode-sum scheme, we give over 14 previously unknown regularisation parameters, almost doubling the current regularisation parameter database. We also produce smooth effective sources to high order, and propose an application of the higher terms to improve accuracy in the m-mode scheme. Finally, we investigate the status of the cosmic censorship conjecture and the role that the self-force plays. To this end, we give regularisation parameters for non-geodesic motion. We also show the necessity of our results in the exciting area of second order self-force calculations, which benefit significantly from high-order coordinate expansions of the singular field. We calculate several parameters that these schemes require, and highlight the further advancements possible from the results of this thesis. ",

However, one comes across it in at least two main occurrences in general relativity: in the negative-$r$ region of Kerr spacetime, and as the result of the gravitational interaction between matter and antimatter, when the latter is assumed to be CPT-transformed matter. Here we show how these two independent developments of general relativity are perfectly consistent in predicting gravitational repulsion and how the above Kerr negative-$r$ region can be interpreted as the habitat of antimatter. As a consequence, matter particles traveling along vortical geodesics can pass through the throat of a rotating black hole and emerge as antimatter particles (and vice versa). An experimental definitive answer on the gravitational behavior of antimatter is awaited in the next few years. ",

We construct characteristic initial data for the Robinson-Trautman dynamics which are interpreted as corresponding to the early post-merger state of two boosted colliding black holes with a common apparent horizon. Our analysis is based on the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum conservation laws which regulate the radiative transfer processes involved in the emission of gravitational waves. We evaluate the Bondi-Sachs momentum flux carried out by gravitational waves and the associated net kick velocity defined (in a zero-initial-Bondi-momentum frame) as proportional to the total gravitational wave impulse imparted on the system. The kick velocity distributions are obtained and analyzed for two distinct classes of initial data corresponding to the early post-merger state of (i) non-head-on collisions and (ii) head-on collisions of black holes. For the first class (i), the net gravitational wave momentum fluxes and associated kicks are evaluated for a given domain of parameters (incidence angle and mass ratio). Typically for the equal mass case the net gravitational wave momentum flux carried is nonzero. This last result indicates that these configurations are not connected with black hole binary inspirals or head-on collisions. We suggest that these systems might be a candidate to an approximate description of the post-merger phase of a non-head-on collision of black holes not preceded by a pre-merger inspiral phase, as for instance colliding black holes in pre-merger unbounded trajectories. For the second class (ii), head-on collisions, we compare our results, and discuss the analogies, with $1+3$ numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole inspirals and head-on collisions. ",

    "abstract": "  The present thesis is devoted towards the study of various aspects of the phase transition phenomena occurring in black holes defined in an Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space. Based on the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and considering a grand canonical framework we examine various aspects of the phase transition phenomena occurring in AdS black holes. We analytically check that this phase transition between the smaller and larger mass black holes obey Ehrenfest relations defined at the critical point and hence confirm a second order phase transition. This include both the rotating and charged black holes in Einstein gravity. Apart from studying these issues, based on a canonical framework, we also investigate the critical behavior in charged AdS black holes. The scaling laws for these black holes are found to be compatible with the static scaling hypothesis. Finally, based on the usual framework of AdS/CFT duality, we investigate the phase transition phenomena occurring in charged hairy black holes defined in an asymptotically AdS space. Based on analytic calculations, and using the AdS/CFT dictionary, we explicitly compute the order-parameter for the dual CFT close to the critical point of the phase transition and found that the critical exponent associated with the condensation is $\\frac{1}{2}$, which is the universal result of the mean field theory. Moreover, we also find that in the presence of an external magnetic field, the dual CFT exhibit a perfect diamagnetism at low temperatures, which may be regarded as the reminiscent of the so called Meissner effect.

The relevant wave functions are related to torsional affine potentials which bear invariance under the action of the generalized Weyl gauge group. Such potentials are thus taken to carry an observable character and emerge from contracted spin affinities whose patterns are chosen in a suitable way. New covariant calculational techniques are then developed towards deriving explicitly the wave equations that supposedly control the propagation in spacetime of the dark energy background. What immediately comes out of this derivation is a presumably natural display of interactions between the fields and both spin torsion and curvatures. The physical properties that may arise directly from the solutions to the wave equations are not brought out. ",

    "abstract": "  In special relativity, clock networks may be self-consistently synchronized in an inertial frame by slowly transporting clocks, or by exchanging electromagnetic signals between network nodes. However, clocks at rest in a rotating coordinate system--such as on the surface of the rotating earth--cannot be self-consistently synchronized by such processes, due to the Sagnac effect. Discrepancies that arise are proportional to the area swept out by a vector from the rotation axis to the portable clock or electromagnetic pulse, projected onto a plane normal to the rotation axis. This raises the question whether paths of minimal or extremal length can be found, for which the Sagnac discrepancies are zero. This paper discusses the variational problem of finding such \"isosynchronous\" paths on rotating discs and rotating spheres. On a disc, the problem resembles the classical isoperimetric problem and the paths turn out to be circular arcs. On a rotating sphere, however, between any two endpoints there are an infinite number of extremal paths, described by elliptic functions. ",

In particular, we observe a decline of the strength of the current quadrupole moment as compared to that of the mass quadrupole moment during the merger phase, contrary to a naive estimate according to the dependence of these moments on the separation between the black holes. We further show that this decline of the current quadrupole moment is achieved through the remnants of the two individual spins becoming nearly aligned or anti-aligned with the total angular momentum. We also speculate on the implication of our observations for achieving a consistency between the electric and magnetic parity quasinormal modes. ",

    "abstract": "  The paper deals with a special kind of problems that appear in solutions of Einstein's field equations for extended bodies: many structure-dependent terms appear in intermediate calculations that cancel exactly in virtue of the local equations of motion or can be eliminated by appropriate gauge transformations. For a single body at rest these problems are well understood for both the post-Newtonian and the post-Minkowskian cases. However, the situation is still unclear for approximations of higher orders. This paper discusses this problem for a \"body\" of spherical symmetry to post-linear order. We explicitly demonstrate how the usual Schwarzschild field can be derived directly from the field equations in the post-linear approximation in the harmonic gauge and for an arbitrary spherically symmetric matter distribution. Both external and internal solutions are considered. The case of static incompressible fluid is then compared to the well-known results from the literature. The results of this paper can be applied to generalize the well-known post-Newtonian and post-Minkowskian multipole expansions of the metric in the post-linear approximation. ",

    "abstract": "  Gravitational redshift is generally calculated without considering the rotation of a body. Neglecting the rotation, the geometry of space time can be described by using the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild geometry. Rotation has great effect on general relativity, which gives new challenges on gravitational redshift. When rotation is taken into consideration spherical symmetry is lost and off diagonal terms appear in the metric. The geometry of space time can be then described by using the solutions of Kerr family. In the present paper we discuss the gravitational redshift for rotating body by using Kerr metric. The numerical calculations has been done under Newtonian approximation of angular momentum. It has been found that the value of gravitational redshift is influenced by the direction of spin of central body and also on the position (latitude) on the central body at which the photon is emitted. The variation of gravitational redshift from equatorial to non - equatorial region has been calculated and its implications are discussed in detail. ",

This anomalous gravitational coupling can in principle avoid the model to pass local gravity experiments. One then usually assumes that the scalar field has a chameleon behavior in the sense that it acquires a density-dependent effective mass. While it can take a small effective mass in cosmological (low-density environment) scale, it has a sufficiently heavy mass in Solar System (large-density environment) and then hides gravity tests. We will argue that such a chameleon behavior can not be generally realized and depends significantly on the forms attributed to the potential and the coupling functions. ",

    "abstract": "  Superpotentials offer a direct means of calculating conserved charges associated with the asymptotic symmetries of space-time. Yet superpotentials have been plagued with inconsistencies, resulting in nonphysical or incongruent values for the mass, angular momentum and energy loss due to radiation. The approach of Regge and Teitelboim, aimed at a clear Hamiltonian formulation with a boundary, and its extension to the Lagrangian formulation by Julia and Silva have resolved these issues, and have resulted in a consistent, well-defined and unique variational equation for the superpotential, thereby placing it on a firm footing. A hallmark solution of this equation is the KBL superpotential obtained from the first-order Lovelock Lagrangian. Nevertheless, here we show that these formulations are still insufficient for Lovelock Lagrangians of higher orders. We present a paradox, whereby the choice of fields affects the superpotential for equivalent on-shell dynamics. We offer two solutions to this paradox: either the original Lagrangian must be effectively renormalized, or that boundary conditions must be imposed, so that space-time be asymptotically maximally symmetric. Non-metricity is central to this paradox, and we show how quadratic non-metricity in the bulk of space-time contributes to the conserved charges on the boundary, where it vanishes identically. This is a realization of the gravitational Higgs mechanism, proposed by Percacci, where the non-metricity is the analogue of the Goldstone boson. ",

First we introduce the concept of reciprocal metric. We prove a theorem which shows how we can construct a certain new static solution of Einstein field equations using a seed metric. Later we investigate the family of stationary spacetimes of such reciprocal metrics. The key here is a theorem from Ehlers', which relates any static vacuum solution to a unique stationary metric. The stationary metric has a magnetic charge. The spacetime represents Newman -Unti-Tamburino (NUT) solutions. Since any stationary spacetime can be decomposed into a $1+3$ time-space decomposition, Einstein field equations for any stationary spacetime can be written in the form of Maxwell's equations for gravitoelectromagnetic fields. Further we show that this set of equations is invariant under reciprocal transformations. An additional point is that the NUT charge changes the sign. As an instructive example, by starting from the reciprocal Schwarzschild as a spherically symmetric solution and reciprocal Morgan-Morgan disk model as seed metrics we find their corresponding stationary space-times. Starting from any static seed metric, performing the reciprocal transformation and by applying an additional Ehlers' transforation we obtain a family of NUT spaces with negative NUT factor (reciprocal NUT factors).

In the framework of the joint nonlinear realization of conformal and affine symmetries the interpretation of the last cosmological observational data of Ia Supernovae, anisotropy of the primordial radiation temperature and the mass spectrum of electroweak bosons, including the Higgs particle mass in the expected region ~ 125 GeV, is given. All these observational and experimental data testify to the vacuum energy dominance. The vacuum Casimir energy is a source of intensive cosmological quantum creation gravitons and electroweak bosons including Higgs particles from the empty Universe during the first 10^(-12) sec. The products of decay of the electroweak bosons give the matter content of the present day Universe, including primordial radiation and its baryon asymmetry. ",

We have analysed the generalized second law (GSL) of thermodynamics in a flat universe consists of interacting dark energy and dark matter. We did the analysis both under thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. If the apparent horizon is taken as the boundary of the universe, we have shown that the rate of change of the total entropy of the universe is proportional to $(1+q)^2,$ which in fact shows that the GSL is valid at the apparent horizon irrespective of the sign of $q,$ the deceleration parameter. Hence for any form of dark energy the apparent horizon can be considered as a perfect thermodynamic boundary of the universe. We made a confirmation of this conclusion by using the holographic dark energy. When event horizon is taken as the boundary, we found that the GSL is only partially satisfied. The analysis under non-equilibrium conditions revealed that the GSL is satisfied if the dark energy temperature is greater than the temperature of dark matter. ",

For the first time, we demonstrate that the two synthetic data streams pertaining to the two polarizations of Gravitational Wave can be derived prior to the maximum-likelihood analysis in a most natural way using the technique of singular-value-decomposition applied to the network signal-to-noise ratio vector. We construct the network matched filters in combined network plus spectral space which capture both the synthetic streams. We further show that the network LLR is then sum of the LLR of each synthetic stream. The four extrinsic parameters are mapped to the two amplitudes and two phases. The maximization over these is a straightforward approach closely linked to the single detector approach. Towards the end, we connect all the previous works related to the multi-detector Gravitational Wave inspiral search and express in the same notation in order to bring under the same footing. ",

Just like for the Schwarzschild black hole, the Robinson gravitational waves are proven to be stable with respect to small perturbations. We conjecture that a bigger class of vacuum solutions are stable, among which are all gravitational solitons. Moreover, the stability analysis reveals a surprising fact: a wave barrier will be transparent to the Robinson waves, which therefore passes through the barrier freely. This is a hint of integrability of the 1+2 vacuum Einstein equations for diagonal metrics. ",

The model has a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry, the matter content is a radiative perfect fluid and the spatial sections have zero constant curvature. In this model the scale factor takes values in a bounded domain. Therefore, its quantum mechanical version has a discrete energy spectrum. We compute the discrete energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions. The energies depend on a noncommutative parameter $\\beta$. We compute the scale factor expected value ($\\left<a\\right>$) for several values of $\\beta$. For all of them, $\\left<a\\right>$ oscillates between maxima and minima values and never vanishes. It gives an initial indication that those models are free from singularities, at the quantum level. The $\\left<a\\right>$ behavior, for the present model, is a drastic modification of the $\\left<a\\right>$ behavior in the corresponding commutative version of the present model. There, $\\left<a\\right>$ grows without limits with the time variable. Therefore, if the present model may represent the early stages of the Universe, the results of the present paper give an indication that $\\left<a\\right>$ may have been, initially, bounded due to noncommutativity.

    "abstract": "  The linearized field equations of general relativity in harmonic coordinates are given by an inhomogeneous wave equation. In the region exterior to the matter field, the retarded solution of this wave equation can be expanded in terms of 10 Cartesian symmetric and tracefree (STF) multipoles in post-Minkowskian approximation. For such a multipole decomposition only three and rather weak assumptions are required:   1. No-incoming radiation condition.   2. The matter source is spatially compact.   3. A spherical expansion for the metric outside the matter source is possible.   During the last decades, the STF multipole expansion has been established as a powerful tool in several fields of gravitational physics: celestial mechanics, theory of gravitational waves and in the theory of light propagation and astrometry. But despite its formidable importance, an explicit proof of the fundamental theorem of STF multipole expansion has not been presented thus far, while only some parts of it are distributed into several publications. In a technical but more didactical form, an explicit and detailed mathematical proof of each individual step of this important theorem of STF multipole expansion is represented. ",

The analysis of Huei's standard approach of Linear Gravity, in which the Einstein equations can be written in the same form of the Maxwell ones, revealed the existence of some imperfections. In fact, the relation between the scalar potential and the electric-type field is not valid except in the harmonic gauge, the Lorentz-type force is obtained with a time independence restriction and an undesired factor 4 appears in the magnetic-type part. A subtle gauge conditions allows us to eliminate these imperfections and to revisit the Linear Gravity in a way to get a strong similarity with electromagnetism. In the linear case, we showed that Maxwell's equations could be derived from an electromagnetic version of the Einstein ones, and that the higher order terms are negligible in the current domain of application of electromagnetism.

Solutions to a straightforward regularization of these constraints have diverging length and volume expectation values. Physically acceptable solutions in the kinematic Hilbert space are obtained from the original constraint by multiplying with a power of the volume operator and by a similar modification of the Hamiltonian constraint, which is used in a regularization of the constraints. The solutions of the modified Killing constraint have finite expectation values of geometric quantities. Further, the expectation value of the original Killing constraint vanishes, but its moment is non-vanishing. As the power of the volume grows the moment of the original constraint grows, while the moments of volume and length both decrease. Thus, these states provide possible kinematic states for flat space, with fluctuations. As a consequence of the regularization of operators the quantum uncertainty relations between geometric quantities such as length and its conjugate momentum do not reflect naive expectations from the classical Poisson bracket relations.
